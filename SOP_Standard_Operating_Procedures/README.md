## Overview

## Definitions

  1. Unless otherwise noted, all terms take on the meaning as defined in [SOP_0005 Complaint Handling](https://github.com/ehwest/mdn_qms/blob/master/SOP_Standard_Operating_Procedures/SOP_0005_Complaint_Handling.md) and [21 CFR 803 Medical Device Reporting](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=803).

## Medical Device Reporting Policy

  1. If MDN becomes aware of a Reportable Event, MDN will file an MDR as follows:
    1. within 5 days of becoming aware that a Reportable Event requires remedial action to prevent an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health;
    2. within 5 days of becoming aware of a reportable event for which the FDA has made a written request;
    3. within 30 days after becoming aware of a reportable death, serious injury, or reportable malfunction.
  2. If it becomes necessary for MDN to file an MDR, it will be done so electronically following instructions from here: [https://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/FDAeSubmitter/ucm108165.htm](https://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/FDAeSubmitter/ucm108165.htm)
  3. Documentation for MDRs will be maintained according to [SOP-0002 Control of Quality Records](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11CaVJcIHQPp6gvABqF2QZAErC3ewIbw1SPJO8AEm7Y0/edit).
