# Configuration Management

Configuration files shall be used in every software design used and developed by Medical Data Networks LLC.  The intent with this use of configuration files is to eliminate and/or reduce the use of command line functions to control and configure the components of T1Pal operations.
In addition, all such configuration files shall be managed as code within the github software repository.

Configuration files will be read upon the deployment and/or restart of new software components.

Configuration files shall themselves be versioned (refer to Semantic Versioning guidelines).
