Stripe and Servicebot.io are providers of billing services to T1Pal operations.

Generally, processing payments 
through a credit card processor can generate personally identifiable information.
However, US Health and Human Services (HHS) have stated that collecting payments is excluded explicitly from HIPAA mandates.
At the same time, 
in order for T1Pal to utilize Stripe for invoicing, and financial analysis, T1Pal will need to get a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
from Stripe, and configure use of Stripe to comply with HIPAA requirements.
A BAA template is expected in follow-on revisions to this QMS.

In addition, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS).
sets the minimum standard for credit card data security, and requires a periodic audit of security operations.
T1Pal expects to achieve PCI Level 4 compliance, which includes use of a checklist and an annual audit.  Both the checklist
and actual audit results will be managed in revisions to this QMS.
 

## Responsibilities

1. The CEO and VP-level employees are responsible for overseeing and maintaining this standard operating procedure and for assuring that all employees are trained in its requirements.
2. It is the responsibility of all employees, contractors and departments at Medical Data Networks to adhere to this procedure.
