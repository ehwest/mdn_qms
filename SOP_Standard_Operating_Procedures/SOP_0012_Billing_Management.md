Services that are expected to yield payment records shall utilize published APIs exposed by ["stripe.com"](https://stripe.com)  and/or ["servicebot.io"](https://servicebot.io) for all such payment procedures.
Reports based on these services shall be considered as authoritative financial records for Medical Data Networks LLC.

In the event a payment process fails and/or a customer payment is late, a short "grace" period will be provided by the billing system.


## Responsibilities

1. The CEO and VP-level employees are responsible for overseeing and maintaining this standard operating procedure and for assuring that all employees are trained in its requirements.
2. It is the responsibility of all employees, contractors and departments at Medical Data Networks to adhere to this procedure.
