## Purpose

1. To establish a standard operating procedures for corrective and preventive action.

2. For corrective actions, this procedure will describe the process for determining the cause of nonconformities, initiating corrective action(s) and performing follow-up to ensure that the corrective action(s) have been effective in eliminating the cause of the nonconformity to prevent recurrence.

3. For preventive actions, this procedure will describe the process of identifying nonconformities and determine actions to prevent their occurrence.

## Scope

This applies to all medical and research software devices designed and developed by Medical Data Networks.

## Analysis and Work Operations, Quality Reports and Records

Medical Data Networks may receive reports of quality issues, complaints and nonconformities, or opportunities for improvement through email, phone calls, social media, or verbal conversations. 

Nonconformances may also be identified through other means such as external or internal audits, and automated monitoring tools. 

Possible mechanisms for handling issues include (but are not limited to):

 * The employee may generate a new GIT repository issue or comment on an existing GIT repository issue indicating a Bug, Feature Request, Suggestion. New GIT repository issues may include risk analysis per QMS SOP Risk Managmeent Procedures.
 
 * The employee may respond to the report over email, phone, or using our customer support tracking system.
 
 * Statistical methods will be applied when necessary and as appropriate at the discretion of management. For example, emails to [support@t1pal.com](mailto:support@t1pal.com) may be analyzed for patterns of recurring customer complaints. When performed, such analysis will be documented and stored in Google Drive.
 
 * Based upon the analysis of these issues, it is determined whether a corrective action or preventive action is required.

At the discretion of Medical Data Networks management or employees, non-conformities that involve severe operational issues, security issues or invalid data may also be detailed in a root cause analysis document (which may be referred to as a &quot;5 Why&#39;s?&quot; document) with details of the cause and actions to prevent recurrence or occurrence of the non-conformity (corrective action or preventive action).

## Verification of Effectiveness

 * Medical Data Networks verifies that the corrective or preventive action does not adversely affect the ability to meet applicable regulatory requirements or the safety and performance of the medical device.
 
 * Medical Data Networks establishes a date to determine the effectiveness of the corrective or preventive action. Effectiveness verification shall include objective evidence to demonstrate that the corrective or preventive action is effective.

## Dissemination of Information

 * All information will be disseminated to appropriate Medical Data Networks employees using email, and/or a Github repository owned by Medical Data Networks LLC.
 
 * Management will review all relevant information. Decisions about corrective and preventive action to be taken in current or future activities will be documented as GIT repository issues. This information is also presented at Management Operations Review meetings.

## Documentation

All documentation regarding quality issues and corrective and preventive action are stored in the company-owned  GitHub in accordance with QMS procedures for Control of Quality Records.
