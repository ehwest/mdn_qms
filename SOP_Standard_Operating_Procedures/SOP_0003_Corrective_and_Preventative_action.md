2. For corrective actions, this procedure will describe the process for determining the cause of nonconformities, initiating corrective action(s) and performing follow-up to ensure that the corrective action(s) have been effective in eliminating the cause of the nonconformity to prevent recurrence.
3. For preventive actions, this procedure will describe the process of identifying nonconformities and determine actions to prevent their occurrence.

## Scope

This applies to all medical and research software devices designed and developed by Medical Data Networks_._

## Analysis and Work Operations, Quality Reports and Records

Medical Data Networks may receive reports of quality issues, complaints and nonconformities, or opportunities for improvement through email, phone calls, social media, or verbal conversations. Nonconformances may also be identified through other means such as external or internal audits, and automated monitoring tools. Possible mechanisms for handling issues include (but are not limited to):

 * The employee may generate a new Jira issue or comment on an existing Jira issue indicating a Bug, Feature Request, Suggestion. New Jira issues may include risk analysis per [SOP-0006 Risk Management](https://github.com/ehwest/mdn_quality_system/blob/master/01_Standard_Operating_Procedures/SOP-0002_Control_of_Quality_Records.md)
 * The employee may respond to the report over email, phone, or using our customer support tracking system.
 * Statistical methods will be applied when necessary and as appropriate at the discretion of management. For example, emails to [support@Medical Data Networks.org](mailto:support@tidepool.org) may be analyzed for patterns of recurring customer complaints. When performed, such analysis will be documented and stored in Google Drive.
 * Based upon the analysis of these issues, it is determined whether a corrective action or preventive action is required.

## Investigation of Cause, Identifying Actions, Implementing and Recording Changes

1. At the conclusion of each development sprint, Medical Data Networks analyzes its processes and operations by holding a Sprint Retrospective meeting. At this retrospective meeting, Medical Data Networks documents, in a Google Doc:
    * What went well (processes that worked well during the sprint)
    * What didn&#39;t go well (process that can use improvement)
    *  What could use improvement (processes or development efforts that should be considered for improvement)
2. At the discretion of Medical Data Networks management or employees, non-conformities that involve severe operational issues, security issues or invalid data may also be detailed in a root cause analysis document (which may be referred to as a &quot;5 Why&#39;s?&quot; document) with details of the cause and actions to prevent recurrence or occurrence of the non-conformity (corrective action or preventive action).

## Verification of Effectiveness

 * Medical Data Networks verifies that the corrective or preventive action does not adversely affect the ability to meet applicable regulatory requirements or the safety and performance of the medical device.
 * Medical Data Networks establishes a date to determine the effectiveness of the corrective or preventive action. Effectiveness verification shall include objective evidence to demonstrate that the corrective or preventive action is effective.

## Dissemination of Information

 * All information will be disseminated to appropriate Medical Data Networks employees using email, Google Docs, Jira, Slack and/or Github.
 * Management will review all relevant information. Decisions about corrective and preventive action to be taken in current or future sprints will be documented as Jira issues. This information is also presented at Management Review meetings.

## Documentation

All documentation regarding quality issues and corrective and preventive action are stored in Jira, Google Docs, Zendesk and GitHub in accordance with [SOP-0002 Control of Quality Records](https://github.com/ehwest/mdn_quality_system/blob/master/01_Standard_Operating_Procedures/SOP-0002_Control_of_Quality_Records.md).
