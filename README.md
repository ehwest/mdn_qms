The QMS system "source" code is in the "source/Quality_Manual" folder.
A build of this source should put finished products in the "build" folder.
In this directory, find a Makefile that supports making the products
and putting them in the build folder.

The Quality Manual is about 40 pages and is document #  QM-0001  
About 30 files numbered QP-0002 ...QP-0030  constitute the various
"procedures" carrying out the many processes identified in the QM-0001.

In addition, there is a folder that contains actual quality records and
templates for quality records.  Authorized users may create new quality records,
although most quality records are created automatically by the github system.

The latest copy of all of these files may be determined by reading the document
hash code created by the github system.


To build the work products, do a 

$ make build
