This document provides a complete overview of the Quality Management System (QMS) used by Medical Data Networks LLC.
More specifically, the QMS system used to deliver operating T1Pal software (...as an FDA device).  

This particular document provides a complete overview of the Quality Management System (QMS) used 
by Medical Data Networks LLC. 
This QMS system is intended to be used to efficiently deliver certain software services (...as an FDA devices).  
"T1Pal" and "CoPilot" are the names of products currently being delivered by this QMS system.
This QMS system is a document-based quality management system.


## Folder and File Organization


[FDA Rules](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/classify-your-medical-device/class-i-ii-exemptions) 
say that all medical devices are subject to the Quality System Regulation (21 CFR 820), 
also referred to as the 
“Current Good Manufacturing Practices” or “Good Manufacturing Practices,” 
unless there is an exception or exemption noted in 21 CFR 820. 
This QMS is a document-based system intended to meet all of these requirements.

Files that are strictly managed by change-control procedures make this QMS work.
Three types of files are provided to registered users:

1. Files describing procedures that shall be used by the QMS
2. Files containing templates used by procedures
3. Files Containing filled-in Templates

One or more files are provided within each  QMS folder, and altogether these folders
and files capture the authoritative description of the QMS.  
Note that within each and every folder listed below, 
a special README.md file is included.  
The README.md file in each folder is intended to 
provide a link to the files in the folder and an overview of all of the files within the QMS folder.

## Requirements


The present Quality Management System (QMS) is specifically intended to achieve and sustain alignment with FDA rules.
The rules are generally categorized as follows:

1. General Regulatory Controls (including Common Good Management Practice, CGMP) of the FDA for medical devices.
2. "Special Controls" of the FDA that are applicable to T1Pal.
3. "Appropriate Validations" applicable to T1Pal.

**"Special Controls"** has further been defined by the FDA as follows:

    A. Devices must protect against unauthorized access to and modification of data.

    B. Device labeling must display the following warnings and limitations:

        1.  **Dosing decisions should not be made based on this device.**

        2.  **The user should follow instructions on the continuous glucose monitoring system.**

        3.  **This device is not intended to replace self-monitoring practices advised by a physician.**


Web-site content (and/or any distributed promotional information) for the T1Pal "device"
is expected to meet all labelling requirements.

However, "protections against unauthorized access to and modification of data" is provided by T1Pal features and functions that must be validated.
For this reason, this QMS includes "Product Definition", "Product Development", and "System Design"
sections needed to convey how this achievement is accomplished and validated.

**NOTE:**  The order of the folders and files of the QMS system is not intended to convey any particular meaning, except that as a whole, the folders, documents, and their links within this QMS "git" management system capture the complete definition of the QMS.


## Scope


All documents that are a part of the Medical Data Networks LLC "Quality Management System" are "electronic records" as defined in FDA Part 11 regulations for the purposes of access, validation, audit, copying, and record retention.  Any paper, letter, article, or other document relevant to this QMS that is received by Medical Data Networks shall be incorporated into this QMS as an electronic document.

These QMS documents are stored in the private (and secured) root of a "github" repository owned and under control of the CEO of Medical Data Networks LLC.

As electronic records, they include a collection of organizing electronic folders and individual files that are rendered using "github.com markdown" style of controlling text document display.

Electronic files that are stored within this repository may have embedded document metadata and markdown symbols that constitute a material part of the controlled document.

Each and every electronic record that is part of the Quality Management System is uniquely named using a string of characters that is the concatenation of the repository root, the folder name under that root, and the file name within that folder.

<repository_root> / <folder_name> / <file_name>

-or-

<repository_root> / <file_name>

By convention, each such component of the whole name has NO SPACES, and used the underscore character "_" to separate memorable elements within the whole string.

Within each document in the system, helpful (but not required) metadata is included within the file identifying the repository root, folder name, and file name. This practice is only intended to facilitate automated assembly and export of Quality Management System documents for casual use.

Authoritative and controlling Quality Management System documents are available for exraction from the Quality Management System repository, and once they are extracted, the copies should not be considered authoritative and/or controlling.

Only the repository "master" branch contains authoritative and/or controlling files.  Other branches may be defined for the purposes of review and testing of the QMS system itself.

The git "master" branch of the git repository is the authoritative, approved, operational set of documents that make up the Quality Management System for Medical Data Networks, LLC.

Individuals may opt to "clone" the entire repository for local off-line reference, and/or may periodically synchronize their own local copy with the controlled "master" branch controlled repository.

A globally unique and immutable electronic "hash" signature computed upon change to any aspect of the Quality Management System is used by the github storage system may be used to determine that a copy of the repository is (and all of the files within it are) identical to the "master" branch of the Quality Management System repository.

The present Quality Management System (QMS) is specifically designed to achieve and sustain the following goals.

1. Registration of T1Pal with the FDA
2. Meet FDA-defined "Special Controls" for T1Pal Operations
3. Support "Appropriate Validations" for T1Pal as a device
4. Implement certain "Special Controls" needed to sustain T1Pal Operations.

In this environment, **"Special Controls"** has been defined by the FDA as follows:

    A. Devices must protect against unauthorized access to and modification of data.

    B. Device labeling must display the following warnings and limitations: 

        1.  **Dosing decisions should not be made based on this device.**
  
        2.  **The user should follow instructions on the continuous glucose monitoring system.**
  
        3.  **This device is not intended to replace self-monitoring practices advised by a physician.**


Web-site content (and/or any distributed promotional information) for the T1Pal "device" 
is expected to meet all labelling requirements.

However, "protections against unauthorized access to and modification of data" is provided by T1Pal features and functions that must be validated.
For this reason, this QMS includes "Product Definition", "Product Development", and "System Design" 
sections needed to convey how this achievement is accomplished and validated.

The order of the folders and files of the QMS system is not intended to convey any particular meaning, except that as a whole, the folders, documents, and their links within this QMS "git" management system capture the complete definition of the QMS.

Within each document in the system, helpful (but not required) metadata is included within the file identifying the repository root, folder name, and file name. This practice is only intended to facilitate automated assembly and export of Quality Management System documents for casual use. 

Authoritative and controlling Quality Management System documents are available for exraction from the Quality Management System repository, and once they are extracted, the copies should not be considered authoritative and/or controlling. 

Only the repository "master" branch contains authoritative and/or controlling files.  Other branches may be defined for the purposes of review and testing of the QMS system itself.

The git "master" branch of the git repository is the authoritative, approved, operational set of documents that make up the Quality Management System for Medical Data Networks, LLC. 

Individuals may opt to "clone" the entire repository for local off-line reference, and/or may periodically synchronize their own local copy with the controlled "master" branch controlled repository.

A globally unique and immutable electronic "hash" signature computed upon change to any aspect of the Quality Management System is used by the github storage system may be used to determine that a copy of the repository is (and all of the files within it are) identical to the "master" branch of the Quality Management System repository. 

This conveniently enables all consumers of the Quality Management System data procesing tools to determine whether or not they have an exact copy of all of the applicable documents. It also enables convenient read-only access to all incremental changes to any file that is part of the Quality Management System electronic record set. This ensures compliance with FDA Part 11 regulations for audit trail capabilities.


## Change Control


Note that the each and every one of the above folder names and the files within each such folder, and their links to other specific QMS folders within the Quality Management System repository,  altogether completely describe the Medical Data Networks LLC Quality Management System.  

The integrity and traceability of all changes to the Quality Management system is maintained in a "git" repository having its document root located here:  https://github.com/ehwest/mdn_qms. It should be noted that the "master" branch of this repository is the current operational repository of the QMS.  Other branches may be used to draft and test changes to the QMS, but are not further described within the QMS.

As such, all documents and artifacts that are part of the Quality Management System are subject to change-control procedures such that each and every change to the Quality Management System documentation is tracked by explicit versioning enforced by the git repository system.


## License


All documents that are part of the Medical Data Networks LLC repository are either licensed to Medical Data Networks LLC and/or are the private property of Medical Data Networks LLC.

All documents created or owned by Medical Data Network's employees are considered proprietary trade secrets and are not for disclosure outside of Medical Data Networks LLC, without specific written permission of an officer of Medical Data Networks LLC.
