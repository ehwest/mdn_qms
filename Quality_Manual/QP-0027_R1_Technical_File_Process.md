    > claimed.

-   A statement of the bench testing and clinical data obtained.

1.  **Technical Documentation Sections – Product Description**

    1.  **Device Description**

> This should include the intended range of variants (for example, a
> group of catheters of a particular type differing only in length), and
> a description of the packaging where this is relevant to the
> preservation of the intended characteristics and performances of the
> device(s). All that is needed, however, is a brief description
> sufficient to allow an understanding of the design, characteristics,
> and where appropriate, performances of the device(s) and to
> distinguish between variants. In many cases, the name of the device(s)
> will be sufficient. Where the ‘technical documentation’ is to be
> evaluated by a Notified Body, a general pictorial representation of
> the device(s), e.g. a schematic diagram, photograph or drawing may be
> of assistance.

1.  **Intended Use**

> A short description of the intended purpose/ application and/or method
> of use of the device(s) is needed. This may include, where
> appropriate, details of the intended patient population(s) and medical
> condition(s) for which the device is intended. This should also make
> clear the intended user(s), in particular whether the device is
> professional use. All of the above may be self-evident from the
> general description of the device(s). The information may be given by
> way of reference to the “instructions for use” or operating manual for
> the device(s). It is not necessary to detail the mechanism by which
> the device(s) achieves its intended purpose.

1.  **Description of Incorporated Medicinal Substances**

> Where the device(s) incorporates a medicinal substance, the ‘technical
> documentation’ should make clear the purpose of including the
> substance and its mode of action in this application. This only
> applies where the substance is liable to act upon the body with action
> ancillary to that of the device. The risk analysis should address the
> additional risks and benefits associated with incorporation of such a
> substance. The technical documentation should include the data on the
> tests conducted in this connection.

1.  **Description of Incorporated Materials of Animal Origin**

> Where the device(s) incorporates non-viable materials of animal
> origin, the risk analysis within the technical documentation should
> address the additional risks and benefits associated with
> incorporation of such materials, and the measures taken (for example,
> in sourcing of animals, veterinary controls and measures taken to
> eliminate/ inactivate transmissible agents).

1.  **Device Classification**

> The technical documentation should include the rule number(s) applied
> under the Regulation, together with a brief rationale for this
> classification, and reasons why particular rules do not apply, if this
> is not self-evident.
>
> In the case of IVDs, the classification of a particular device is
> self-evident from the lists given in Annex II of the IVDD or where the
> device is labeled as for “self-testing”.

1.  **Special Considerations**

> Where aspects of the device(s) are the subject of emerging concern
> (for example, the use of latex potentially leading to allergic
> reaction), the risk analysis within the ‘technical documentation’
> should address these aspects.

1.  **Description of Manufacturing**

> A summary is required in general terms of the type of manufacturing
> method (for example, injection/blow molding, extrusion, chemical
> processing, assembly, packaging/labeling) and the method of
> sterilization, if relevant. This should make clear the technologies
> involved and means of assuring the intended characteristics and
> performances of the devices manufactured. What is not required is an
> exhaustive description of manufacturing processes.

1.  **Description of Accessories**

> The technical documentation should include the description of other
> devices or equipment etc. which the device is intended to be used
> with; for example, where the manufacturer makes specific claims
> concerning compatibility. It should also include data on the
> verification and validation of the safety and performance of such
> combinations.
>
> In describing the requirements for safe and proper operation of the
> device(s) when used in combination with devices or equipment from
> other manufacturers, what is needed is a brief description sufficient
> to understand the important parameters or interfaces (for example, the
> connectors needed or the voltage, frequency and/or stability of the
> electricity supply required).
>
> The technical documentation should also address known
> incompatibilities which may be covered, for example, in the label or
> the instructions for use.

1.  **Technical Documentation Sections – Technical Requirements**

    1.  **Safety and Performance Requirements**

> The manufacturer should make clear the Regulation(s) which apply to
> the particular device(s) concerned, including Directives other than
> the medical devices regulations. Where not self-evident, the
> manufacturer should document the rationale for classifying as a
> medical device and deciding what other, if any, requirements apply.
>
> In each case, those Safety and Performance Requirements (SPRs) of the
> Regulation(s) or Directive(s) and other requirements which apply
> should be identified. The manufacturer should define the technical
> requirements/specifications which must be satisfied in order to ensure
> that each of the applicable Regulation/Directive requirements are met.
>
> Where particular SPRs are deemed not to apply to the device(s)
> concerned, a brief rationale should be given where this is not
> self-evident.

1.  **Safety and Performance Requirement Solutions**

> The manufacturer is required to demonstrate how each of the applicable
> SPR’s and any derived technical requirements/specifications for the
> particular device(s) concerned has been met. Compliance with published
> standards is voluntary.
>
> Where “harmonized standards” are used to comply with relevant SPR’s,
> all that is needed is to demonstrate the device(s) concerned complies
> with the relevant clauses of the “harmonized standard(s)”.
>
> Where other methods, including compliance with draft and
> in-house/industry standards, are used to comply with one of a range of
> relevant SPR’s, the manufacturer should justify that:

-   the methods applied adequately address relevant requirement(s) and

-   the device(s) concerned comply with the relevant provisions of
    > these.

> The evidence of device compliance with standards may take the form of,
> for example, test reports or records of application of Standard
> Operating Procedures (SOPs) intended to assure such compliance.

1.  **List of Standards**

> Where the manufacturer demonstrates conformity with particular SPR’s
> by claiming compliance with available published standards, the
> Regulations require that these standards should be identified. The
> manufacturer should make clear where standards which are applied in
> full or in part are “harmonized standards” (including “common
> technical specifications” in the case of IVDs). Compliance with all or
> parts of such “harmonized standards” carries the presumption of
> conformity with relevant SPR’s of the Regulation(s)/Directive(s).
>
> Where device(s) do not comply with key relevant published standards, a
> rationale should be given.

1.  **Technical Documentation Sections – Design Requirements**

    1.  **Risk Management**

> The manufacturer is required by the regulations to present the
> documented results of the risk analysis.
>
> The risk analysis should address all hazards known or reasonably
> foreseeable for the particular product types and technologies
> involved, together with the likelihood and consequences of occurrence
> and measures taken to reduce the resulting risks to acceptable levels.
> This should address all relevant risks. For example, in the case of
> devices incorporating e.g. a medicinal substance or materials of
> animal origin, or natural rubber latex, the risk analysis should
> include the additional risks and benefits associated with
> incorporation of such substances.
>
> In the case of devices intended and labeled for “single use”, the risk
> analysis should address the hazards associated with reuse as an
> example of foreseeable misuse.
>
> The results must demonstrate that an appropriate risk analysis has
> been performed and provide a conclusion, with appropriate evidence,
> that the remaining risks are acceptable when weighed against the
> intended benefits to the patient. The results of the risk analysis
> should be reviewed when there are changes to product, changes to
> standards, or new information with regards to unrecognized hazards,
> estimated risk, or estimated benefits of the device.

1.  **Material Specifications and Biocompatibility**

> The technical documentation should specify the materials used in the
> construction of the device, together with the biological safety and
> biocompatibility of materials intended to come into contact with the
> body. Particular attention should be paid where materials are invasive
> with respect to the body and/or will have prolonged contact with the
> body.
>
> This may include special processes (e.g. molding, sterilization) and
> environmental conditions to be used for production (e.g. prevention of
> particulate contamination or electrostatic discharge). In the case of
> medical devices covered by the IVDD, this should cover
> characterization of starting materials.
>
> The technical documentation should specify any ‘special processes’,
> for example sterilization, the results of which may affect the safety
> and performance of the finished device(s).

1.  **Product, Sub-Assembly, and Component Specifications**

> The manufacturer should determine what specifications, drawings,
> diagrams etc. are appropriate and sufficient to enable proper
> manufacture, installation, maintenance and servicing etc. of the
> product(s) involved in order to assure the intended characteristics
> and performances are achieved and maintained.
>
> In some cases, the manufacturer will need detailed engineering scale
> drawings for their product(s). Whereas such drawings may be necessary,
> for example, for electro-medical devices, it is often sufficient to
> produce a schematic diagram of, for example, product configuration or
> kit contents with dimensions and other characteristics indicated as
> appropriate.
>
> Equally, it may be necessary to have drawings for certain components
> or sub-assemblies but not for others.

1.  **Test Specifications**

> The procedures, work instructions etc. relating to the conduct of such
> checks, tests and trials form part of the manufacturer’s quality
> system.

1.  **Performance and Compatibilities Intended**

> The manufacturer is required to identify the characteristics,
> performances and compatibilities needed to assure the safe and correct
> operation of the device. A relevant characteristic might be, for
> example, sterility assurance of a catheter. A relevant performance
> might be, for example, the ability of the protective packaging to
> maintain sterility of that catheter when subject to the stresses
> associated with transport and storage.
>
> In the case of IVDs, the indication of performances should include
> those required in connection with analytical performance, for example,
> to do with sensitivity, specificity, limit of detection, and ratio of
> false to true results, where relevant.

1.  **Labeling / Information Supplied by Manufacturer**

> The manufacturer is required to include in the technical documentation
> the label, and where appropriate, the instructions for use, together
> with any changes to these during the lifetime of the product. This
> should include the information to be given, both by text and the use
> of symbols, in the final version of the labeling.
>
> The labeling documentation should make clear where particular
> information will be provided, for example on the device itself or its
> component parts, on the packaging for each unit, on the sales
> packaging, or on the leaflet or user manual supplied with one or more
> devices.
>
> Information may be provided, for example, by means of electronic
> display screens or synthesized voice messages.

1.  **Shelf-Life and Product Lifetime**

> In certain cases, such restrictions on use will reflect a time-related
> deterioration in characteristics that are important to product safety
> and performance. In other cases, however, the restrictions will be
> based on other considerations. The ‘lifetime’ of an active device, for
> example, may be determined by the period for which the manufacturer
> will support the device by way of availability of spare parts,
> manuals, training, service/repairs etc.

1.  **Performance Testing – Bench Data**

> Bench testing includes in-vitro/animal studies, simulated use testing
> and validation of software and the results of special processes (e.g.
> sterilization validation report(s)).

1.  **Performance Testing – Clinical Data**

> Clinical data includes data from market experience of the same or
> similar devices (particularly relevant to ‘well established’ devices),
> prospective clinical investigations and information from the
> scientific literature.
>
> The scientific literature will often relate to medical devices other
> than those being assessed. The manufacturer must therefore establish
> the extent to which the scientific literature is relevant to his
> device(s). The results from bench testing may be used to establish the
> extent to which the characteristics of the device(s) being assessed
> are similar to those of the device(s) covered by the scientific
> literature, and therefore the relevance of that scientific literature.
>
> The manufacturer should make clear where clinical data is being used
> to demonstrate conformity with each of the applicable SPR’ for the
> particular device(s) concerned.

1.  **Design Changes**

> The technical documentation should include records of each design
> change and the reasons for these, together with any associated
> verification/ validation data. The documentation should include
> evidence for believing that the change achieves the desired effect,
> and that the device continues to comply with the requirements of the
> regulations.

1.  **Technical Documentation Sections – Administrative Requirements**

    1.  **Declaration of Conformity**

> The Declaration of Conformity is the attestment of the manufacturer
> that the medical device complies fully with all applicable Essential
> Principles for Safety and Performance. At a minimum, the declaration
> shall include the following information:

-   An attestation that each device that is subject to the declaration:

    -   complies with the applicable Essential Principles for Safety and
        > Performance,

    -   has been classified according to the classification rules, and

    -   has met all the applicable conformity assessment elements.

-   Information sufficient to identify the device/s to which the
    > Declaration of Conformity applies.

-   The Global Medical Device Nomenclature (GMDN) code and term for the
    > device7.

-   The risk class allocated to the device/s after following the
    > guidance found in Principles of Medical Devices Classification8.

-   Which of the conformity assessment elements described in Section 5
    > have been applied.

-   The date from which the Declaration of Conformity is valid.

-   The name and address of the device manufacturer.

-   The name, position and signature of the responsible person who has
    > been authorized to complete the Declaration of Conformity upon the
    > manufacturer’s behalf.
