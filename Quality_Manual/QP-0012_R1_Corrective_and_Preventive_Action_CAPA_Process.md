1.  **Purpose**

 This document defines the company’s policies and procedures for
 completing and documenting corrective and preventive actions. These
 policies and procedures include CAPA inputs, problem identification,
 severity categorization, activity plan, closure, and information
 awareness.

2.  **Scope**

 This procedure applies to all corrective and preventive actions
 initiated. Issues regarding products that have not been released to
 commercialization are exempt from the CAPA process.

3.  **General**

3.1  **Definitions**

        -   **Corrective Action** – Action taken to eliminate the cause
             of an existing nonconformity, defect, or other undesirable
             situation in order to prevent recurrence

        -   **Nonconformity** – Non-fulfillment of a specified
             requirement

        -   **Preventive Action** – Action taken to eliminate the cause
             of a potential nonconformity, defect, or other undesirable
             situation in order to prevent occurrence

3.2  **Responsibilities**

 **QF-0012-1** – Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) Form

 **QP-0011** – Customer Complaints

4.  **Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) Procedure**

 The Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) process is a systemic
 approach to eliminating the cause of an existing or potential
 nonconformity, defect, or other undesirable situation in order to
 prevent the occurrence. The actions taken to eliminate the root causes
 of actual nonconformance(s) shall be to a degree appropriate to the
 magnitude of problems and consistent with the associated risks. The
 problem solving methodology utilized contains elements from PDCA,
 DMAIC, and 8D principles.

4.1  **CAPA Inputs**

 Inputs for the CAPA process include, but are not limited to data
 analysis and management review of the following:

-   Process Monitoring

-   Complaint Files

-   Nonconforming Product

-   Acceptance Activities

-   Servicing

-   Audits

-   Medical Device Reporting and Recalls

 Not all complaints and nonconforming products are CAPA’s, it is
 dependent on items such as risk and type of error (systematic vs.
 random).

4.2  **Problem Identification**

 Effort shall be taken to clearly and completely describe the problem
 associated with the CAPA. The problem statement shall define an
 achievable scope and contain as many pertinent facts as are available.
 Ambiguous information, feelings, opinions, etc shall not be included
 in the problem statement.

4.3  **Severity Categorization**

 The severity of a CAPA is determined utilizing the methodology
 described in ISO 14971. Each CAPA shall be classified as Minor,
 Moderate, or Major based on the associated risk to the end user and
 the business. The severity of the CAPA drives priority levels, company
 awareness, and the degree of the actions taken in the Action Plan.
 Tables in Appendix A shall be utilized to determine associated risk.

4.4  **CAPA Action Plan**

 The following planned activities shall be completed as necessary to
 carry out an effective CAPA. Containment and Disposition activities
 may not be required for preventive actions or actions that do not
 involve product. Each activity shall be documented in the CAPA file
 and the CAPA will remain open until each activity has been completed
 and approved by Department and Quality Management.

 The activity plans shall be initiated upon the opening of a CAPA by
 the Quality Department and identification of the problem or issue. All
 reasonable efforts shall be made to complete and close CAPA plans in a
 timely manner without undue delay.

4.4.1  **Containment**

 The objective of the containment phase is to prevent the distribution
 or propagation of the identified defect or issue. This is done
 immediately upon identification of the problem to minimize risk and
 actions taken should error on the side on conservatism. Once the root
 cause has been determined in subsequent phases, the containment
 activities can be re-evaluated to release items that are unnecessarily
 being held. Examples of containment activities include: QC Hold,
 Product Quarantine, and Production Shutdown.

4.4.2  **Investigation**

 The objective of the investigation activity is to gather and analyze
 as much information/data as necessary to determine the root cause of
 the issue (if possible) and an effective solution to prevent its
 reoccurrence. Common tools utilized in root cause analysis include:

-   Fault-tree Analysis

-   5 “whys”

-   Fishbone Diagrams

-   Pareto Charts

-   Scatter Diagrams

 If during the investigation information is uncovered that should be
 reported to customers, the advisory notice procedure defined in Doc
 QP-0011 shall be utilized.

4.4.3  **Implementation Plan and Execution**

 The implementation is a four part activity; PDCA. The first is
 developing the implementation plan. the second is the execution of
 that plan, the third is verification or validation that activities
 were effective and do not adversely affect the medical device, and the
 fourth and final step is to fully implement the corrective or
 preventive actions. The actions taken shall be optimized to the
 magnitude of the problem and associated risk. As part of the
 implementation plan, consider the effectiveness check and the criteria
 for acceptance.

4.4.4  **Disposition**

 The disposition of affected product may proceed at any point following
 the completion of the investigation. All associated product shall be
 dispositioned prior to closure of the CAPA. The following are examples
 of acceptable dispositions:

-   No impact to product, acceptable for distribution

-   Rework

-   Scrap

-   Use As Is with justification

4.4.5  **Effectiveness Check**

 The effectiveness check shall verify or validate that the corrective
 and preventive action had the intended results and did not adversely
 affect the quality of finished product. The effectiveness check shall
 provide confidence that the risk of reoccurrence has been
 appropriately mitigated.

4.5  **CAPA Closure and Information Awareness**

 Corrective and Preventive Actions shall remain open until all action
 items are completed and documented. Once complete, the documentation
 shall be reviewed and approved by the responsible department
 management and the quality department. The responsible department
 management shall ensure that information related to quality problems
 or nonconforming product is disseminated to those directly responsible
 for assuring the quality of such product or the prevention of such
 problems.

 Upon opening a CAPA, the expected closure date is set to 60 days. In
 the event additional time is necessary to complete all applicable
 sections, an extension shall be submitted and approved by Quality
 Management. Granted extensions shall be noted on the CAPA Log.

6.  **Appendix A – Risk Assessment**

 The following risk assessment methodology has been developed utilizing
 principles from ISO 14971.

6.1  **Severity Assessment**

Severity Index|Severity Category|Description of Severity
--------------|-----------------|-----------------------
S1|None|No safety concerns and minimal to no impact on quality or product or service.
S2|Minor|Customer annoyed and/or insignificant injury
S3|Moderate|Loss of efficacy and/or significannt injury
S4|Serious|Significant injury that is epected to result in permanent impairment, even with major medical intervention.
S5|Critical|Severe injury where major medical intervention is required to prevent loss of life or when loss of life cannot be prevented.

6.2  **Probability of Occurrence Assessment**

Probability Index|Rate of Failure
-----------------|--------------
P1| < 0.01%
P2|0.01% - 0.10%
P3|0.11% - 1.00%
P4|1.01% - 10.00%
P5|> 10.00%

6.3  **Risk Assessment**

Risk Index R = s x p|Risk Category
--------------------|-------------
R1 to R6 | Minor
R8 to R10 | Moderate
R12 to R25 | Major
