1.  **General**

    1.  **Definitions**

        -   **Corrective Action** – Action taken to eliminate the cause
            > of an existing nonconformity, defect, or other undesirable
            > situation in order to prevent recurrence

        -   **Nonconformity** – Non-fulfillment of a specified
            > requirement

        -   **Preventive Action** – Action taken to eliminate the cause
            > of a potential nonconformity, defect, or other undesirable
            > situation in order to prevent occurrence

1.  **Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) Procedure**

> The Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) process is a systemic
> approach to eliminating the cause of an existing or potential
> nonconformity, defect, or other undesirable situation in order to
> prevent the occurrence. The actions taken to eliminate the root causes
> of actual nonconformance(s) shall be to a degree appropriate to the
> magnitude of problems and consistent with the associated risks. The
> problem solving methodology utilized contains elements from PDCA,
> DMAIC, and 8D principles.

1.  **CAPA Inputs**

> Inputs for the CAPA process include, but are not limited to data
> analysis and management review of the following:

-   Process Monitoring

-   Complaint Files

-   Nonconforming Product

-   Acceptance Activities

-   Servicing

-   Audits

-   Medical Device Reporting and Recalls

> Not all complaints and nonconforming products are CAPA’s, it is
> dependent on items such as risk and type of error (systematic vs.
> random).

1.  **Problem Identification**

> Effort shall be taken to clearly and completely describe the problem
> associated with the CAPA. The problem statement shall define an
> achievable scope and contain as many pertinent facts as are available.
> Ambiguous information, feelings, opinions, etc shall not be included
> in the problem statement.

1.  **Severity Categorization**

> The severity of a CAPA is determined utilizing the methodology
> described in ISO 14971. Each CAPA shall be classified as Minor,
> Moderate, or Major based on the associated risk to the end user and
> the business. The severity of the CAPA drives priority levels, company
> awareness, and the degree of the actions taken in the Action Plan.
> Tables in Appendix A shall be utilized to determine associated risk.

1.  **CAPA Action Plan**

> The following planned activities shall be completed as necessary to
> carry out an effective CAPA. Containment and Disposition activities
> may not be required for preventive actions or actions that do not
> involve product. Each activity shall be documented in the CAPA file
> and the CAPA will remain open until each activity has been completed
> and approved by Department and Quality Management.
>
> The activity plans shall be initiated upon the opening of a CAPA by
> the Quality Department and identification of the problem or issue. All
> reasonable efforts shall be made to complete and close CAPA plans in a
> timely manner without undue delay.

1.  **Containment**

> The objective of the containment phase is to prevent the distribution
> or propagation of the identified defect or issue. This is done
> immediately upon identification of the problem to minimize risk and
> actions taken should error on the side on conservatism. Once the root
> cause has been determined in subsequent phases, the containment
> activities can be re-evaluated to release items that are unnecessarily
> being held. Examples of containment activities include: QC Hold,
> Product Quarantine, and Production Shutdown.

1.  **Investigation**

> The objective of the investigation activity is to gather and analyze
> as much information/data as necessary to determine the root cause of
> the issue (if possible) and an effective solution to prevent its
> reoccurrence. Common tools utilized in root cause analysis include:

-   Fault-tree Analysis

-   5 “whys”

-   Fishbone Diagrams

-   Pareto Charts

-   Scatter Diagrams

> If during the investigation information is uncovered that should be
> reported to customers, the advisory notice procedure defined in Doc
> QP-0011 shall be utilized.

1.  **Implementation Plan and Execution**

> The implementation is a four part activity; PDCA. The first is
> developing the implementation plan. the second is the execution of
> that plan, the third is verification or validation that activities
> were effective and do not adversely affect the medical device, and the
> fourth and final step is to fully implement the corrective or
> preventive actions. The actions taken shall be optimized to the
> magnitude of the problem and associated risk. As part of the
> implementation plan, consider the effectiveness check and the criteria
> for acceptance.

1.  **Disposition**

> The disposition of affected product may proceed at any point following
> the completion of the investigation. All associated product shall be
> dispositioned prior to closure of the CAPA. The following are examples
> of acceptable dispositions:

-   No impact to product, acceptable for distribution

-   Rework

-   Scrap

-   Use As Is with justification

    1.  **Effectiveness Check**

> The effectiveness check shall verify or validate that the corrective
> and preventive action had the intended results and did not adversely
> affect the quality of finished product. The effectiveness check shall
> provide confidence that the risk of reoccurrence has been
> appropriately mitigated.

1.  **CAPA Closure and Information Awareness**

> Corrective and Preventive Actions shall remain open until all action
> items are completed and documented. Once complete, the documentation
> shall be reviewed and approved by the responsible department
> management and the quality department. The responsible department
> management shall ensure that information related to quality problems
> or nonconforming product is disseminated to those directly responsible
> for assuring the quality of such product or the prevention of such
> problems.
>
> Upon opening a CAPA, the expected closure date is set to 60 days. In
> the event additional time is necessary to complete all applicable
> sections, an extension shall be submitted and approved by Quality
> Management. Granted extensions shall be noted on the CAPA Log.
