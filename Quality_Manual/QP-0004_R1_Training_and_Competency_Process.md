> the skills and training directly associated with internal policies and
> procedures.
>
> The company determines management positions to be considered competent
> to perform required job duties based on Personnel Qualifications.
> Management does not require Quality System Training unless job
> function involves direct interaction with product and/or service
> quality.

1.  **Personnel Qualifications**

> and defined within a job description that is maintained by Human
> Resources. The job description is specific to the position and is
> comprised of information such as position title, location, description
> of responsibilities, and education/skill requirements.
>
> Documented evidence of Personnel Qualifications is maintained within
> each employee’s personnel files. The type of documented evidence is
> determined by Human Resources and is dependent on the requirements
> defined within the job description. Examples include job applications,
> resumes, certifications, etc.

1.  **Quality System Training**

> employees to complete assigned tasks. Training shall include any
> identified defects or errors that are associated with job performance
