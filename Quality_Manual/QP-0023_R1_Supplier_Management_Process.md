1.  **Supplier Management Procedure**

> The company utilizes a tiered system for managing suppliers. The
> supplier level is dependent upon risk associated with the product or
> service provided and the potential for impacting the quality of the
> products and services provided to our customers. The supplier level is
> determined by the Quality Department and documented on QF-0023-1,
> Supplier Approval Form. Level 1 Suppliers are considered critical
> suppliers. The list below provides examples of suppliers for each
> category:

-   **Level 1 Suppliers** – Suppliers of finished medical devices

-   **Level 2 Suppliers** – Contract manufacturer of components and/or
    > supplier of critical services including distribution and
    > warehousing. Suppliers of components with a moderate to high
    > associated risk.

-   **Level 3 Suppliers** – Component suppliers, Calibration and Test
    > Labs, Clinical Sites, Quality Management Services

-   **Level 4 Suppliers** – Non-QMS Suppliers, Distributors and
    > Manufacturers of Off-the-Shelf items with an acceptable quality
    > history.

-   **Non Production Resource (NPR)** – Business entity, government
    > agency, or utility provider that provides a service or product
    > that is not used in any products.

    1.  **Supplier Planning and Selection**

> The need for a new supplier is generally identified through activities
> associated with Design and Development, Engineering Change Orders,
> and/or CAPA’s. The selection of a supplier to be approved is
> determined with input from Engineering, and Operations. Preference
> shall be given to expanding the qualification of an existing supplier
> with acceptable performance over approving a new supplier, where
> practical. When possible, multiple quotes shall be obtained for the
> desired product or service prior to selecting a supplier for
> evaluation. The table below identifies the minimum requirements for
> supplier selection based on the supplier level

> \* As Required \* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ - Minimum of one of the evaluation
> criteria indicated

1.  **Supplier Evaluation and Approval**

> Suppliers shall be evaluated to ensure the entity is capable of
> supplying products and/or services in accordance with company
> requirements and evidence of the evaluation shall be maintained within
> the supplier file.
>
> If the supplier will perform processes that are required to be
> validated to ensure quality requirements of the final product have
> been met, the associated validation documents shall be obtained and
> reviewed for acceptability before the supplier will be approved.
>
> Suppliers are evaluated to ensure the entity is capable of supplying
> products and/or services in accordance with company requirements and
> evidence of the evaluation is maintained within the supplier file.
> These records contain at minimum one of the following items
> demonstrating supplier evaluation where applicable. Additional
> Evaluation information may be included as desired.
>
> Final supplier approval is documented on QF-0023-1, Supplier Approval
> Form
>
> Evaluation Criteria may include the following criteria or other
> criteria as seen as sufficient to ensure final product quality
> requirements are met:

-   Completed Supplier Survey (QF-0023-2), Supplier Audit Report
    > (QP-0015) and/or QMS Certification

-   Resumes, Curriculum Vitae, Licenses, or Certificates

-   Contract Agreements

-   Evidence of Supplier Controls

-   Evidence of compliance to 21 CFR 820 quality system requirements for
    > functions outsourced to the supplier

-   Completed 1<sup>st</sup> Article Inspections (QF-0023-4)

> Level 1 Suppliers of medical devices shall have a valid ISO 13485
> certificate issued by a notified body with a scope of registration
> appropriate to the product being manufactured.
>
> Level 1 Suppliers require an onsite audit to ensure compliance with
> applicable FDA regulations and Quality Management System requirements
> for the activities outsourced to the supplier.
>
> Level 1 Suppliers shall be re-evaluated and/or audited every three (3)
> years to ensure continued compliance and performance. Tracking of
> these activities is maintained on the Supplier Audit Schedule.

1.  **Supplier Controls**

> Supplier Controls to be considered are listed below. Where sufficient
> objective evidence of supplier controls to ISO 13485, 21 CFR 820 or
> other Quality System Requirements cannot be verified, a supplier audit
> shall be conducted in accordance with QP-0015 – Quality Audits.

-   **Process Input Controls** - raw material, machine
    > programs/settings, revision control of process documentation, and
    > (if applicable) temperature settings/speeds/feeds/etc.

-   **Process Maintenance** - calibration of machines/process
    > indicators, and maintenance of machine tools and periodic toll
    > verification cycles

-   **Traceability of Records** - raw material, finished lot, and
    > inspection/acceptance data

-   **Verification and Acceptance**:

    -   Incoming, In-Process, and Final Inspection and Testing

    -   Risk Assessment and Control Plan

    -   100% inspection for final acceptance or a sampling plan. If a
        > sampling plan, is there rationale for the plan and was the
        > plan approved?

    -   Product yield information trending

-   **Validation** - For any critical dimension that is not verified
    > each time, what validation has been completed to support no
    > verification of the specification? Validations are reviewed and
    > approved for adequacy to ensure product quality requirements are
    > met.

> First Article Inspections (FAI’s) are utilized to verify the effective
> communication and implementation of product specifications and
> supplier controls. First article inspections are documented on
> QF-0023-4 and verify critical specifications of the product.

1.  **Supplier Measurement and Monitoring**

> Suppliers are monitored and measured to ensure acceptable performance
> and identify areas in need of improvement. Data is obtained from
> multiple sources including, but not limited to:

-   NCR/SCAR’s

-   On Time Delivery

-   Customer Complaints

-   Audit Reports

> An evaluation of the supplier data is completed annually as part of
> the Management review process. Continual poor performance may initiate
> a supplier audit, SCAR’s, or debarment from the ASL.

1.  **Feedback and Communication**

> Performance feedback is provided to suppliers via corrective action
> requests, supplier audit reports, and general business correspondence.
> In the event that material is received out of specification, the
> supplier will be issued a Supplier Corrective Action Request (SCAR)
> (QF-0023-3).

-   Containment Actions – Actions taken to quarantine and prevent the
    > distribution of other impacted products.

-   Root Cause Determination – An investigation to identify the root
    > cause of the issue including potential impacts to other product
    > and historical review.

-   Corrective and Preventive Actions – The actions taken to correct the
    > issues and prevent the issue from re-occurring.

-   Effectiveness Check – Verification activities to ensure the
    > corrective and preventive action were effective.

> The supplier must make all reasonable efforts to complete corrective
> and preventive actions and provide documented evidence of completion.
> Root cause and corrective action shall be identified within 30 days
> and implemented within 90 days unless otherwise agreed to by Quality
> Assurance. Failure to supply products and/or services that meet
> company specifications or failure to respond to or complete SCAR’s
> will result in Debarred status on the ASL.

1.  **Approved Supplier List**

> Upon evaluation and acceptance, a supplier is added to the Approved
> Supplier List (ASL). The Approved Supplier List is approved by
> Quality.

1.  **Required Information**

> The following information is recorded for all suppliers listed on the
> ASL:

1.  **Supplier Status**

> Each supplier on the ASL is assigned a status. This status can change
> as the results of Supplier Measurement and Monitoring, SCAR’s, and/or
> management review of ASL. Inactive suppliers shall be re-assessed
> against the supplier qualification requirements and assessment
> documented prior to being upgraded to an Approved status.

-   **Approved** – a supplier that has met all requirements for approval
    > and maintained an acceptable level of quality.

-   **Debarred** – a supplier that is no longer usable or has failed to
    > successfully establish and maintain an acceptable level of
    > quality.

-   **Inactive** – an approved supplier that has had a lapse in activity
    > (receipt of product, or PO issuance) greater than 2-years.
