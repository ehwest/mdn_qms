1.  **Nonconforming Product Procedure**

> Nonconforming products are documented on nonconformance reports
> (NCR’s). Nonconforming products are generally identified as the
> results of formal verification, inspection, or test activities;
> however, may be identified at any point. The following procedures are
> utilized to ensure the appropriate handling of nonconforming product.
> Nonconforming product trending and analysis is accomplished through
> Management Review and Data Analysis Process (QP-0013).

1.  **Control of Nonconforming Product**

> Nonconforming product should be appropriately identified and
> quarantined to prevent the inadvertent use or distribution of the
> product. The specific method of identification is dependent on the
> product and may consist of appropriately labeled bins, tags, sticker,
> etc. All nonconforming product shall be segregated from product
> acceptable for distribution.

1.  **Product Review and Disposition**

> Nonconforming product shall be reviewed and dispositioned
> appropriately by the Material Review Board (MRB). The MRB shall
> consist of functional expertise from each department impacted by the
> nonconformance. The Quality Department is responsible for ensuring the
> necessary parties are represented. Team members typically include
> Operations, Engineering, Marketing, and Quality. Authority to review
> and disposition nonconforming product may be delegated to an
> individual for previously identified and reviewed failure modes. All
> reasonable efforts shall be made to document and disposition NCR’s in
> a timely manner.

1.  **Review**

> The MRB shall review each nonconforming product and document this
> review on the NCR Form. If the nonconformance is determined to be
> systematic, the MRB may escalate the NCR to a CAPA (QP-0012). The MRB
> shall determine and implement any necessary corrections. Review shall
> include potential impacts to other products and whether notification
> is necessary to any external party responsible for the nonconformity.

1.  **Disposition**

> The disposition of the nonconforming product shall be determined and
> approved through the MRB. The disposition of the product shall be
> documented on the NCR form. The following are examples of acceptable
> dispositions:

-   No impact to product, acceptable for distribution

-   Rework

-   Return to Supplier

-   Scrap

-   Acceptance under Concession

> Any product accepted under concession is required to meet all
> regulatory requirements and the identity of the authorizing person(s)
> shall be documented.

1.  **Rework of Nonconforming Product**

> Nonconforming product that has been dispositioned for rework shall be
> processed under documented procedures that have undergone the same
> authorization as the original production process procedures. Any
> adverse effect of rework upon the product shall be evaluated and
> documented on the NCR Form.
