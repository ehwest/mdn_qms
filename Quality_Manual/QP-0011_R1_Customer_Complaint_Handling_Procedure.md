1.  **General**

    1.  **Definitions**

        1.  **Adverse Event** – An event that resulted in serious
            > injuries and/or death or a malfunction event that would
            > likely cause or contribute to serious injury if the
            > malfunction were to recur.

        2.  **Become Aware** – When any employee has acquired
            > information that reasonably suggests a reportable adverse
            > event has occurred.

            > release for distribution.

        4.  **Malfunction** – The failure of a device to meet its
            > performance specifications or otherwise perform as
            > intended. Performance specifications include all claims
            > made in the labeling for the device. The intended
            > performance of a device refers to the intended use for
            > which the device is labeled or marketed.

        5.  **Serious Injury** – An injury or illness that is
            > life-threatening, results in permanent impairment of the

> implementation and continued compliance with the procedures specified
> in this document and by the regulatory authorities.

1.  **Training Requirement** – Quality Assurance personnel shall be

1.  **Customer Complaint Handling Procedure**

> This procedure guides the complaint handling process including
> receiving, reviewing, and evaluating customer complaints by a formally
> designated staff. This procedure ensures that:

1.  All complaints are processed in a uniform manner and reviewed within
    > two days after receiving them to determine reportability based
    > upon MDR requirements;

2.  Verbal complaints are documented upon receipt;

3.  Complaints are evaluated to determine whether they represent
    > reportable events as defined by MDR requirements and applicable
    > regulations;

4.  All complaint investigations are completed within 15 days unless
    > otherwise documented with appropriate rationale.

5.  Customer complaints are trended.

> A customer complaint may be received by any employee and is documented
> on the Customer Complaint Form (QF-0011-1). Each complaint is reviewed
> and investigated by quality staff. Complaints involving possible
> failure of a device, labeling, or packaging will be reviewed and
> investigated, unless such investigation has already been performed for
> a similar complaint. Where no investigation is necessary, a rationale
> will be documented along with decision maker’s name.
>
> Complaints representing events which must be reported to FDA under MDR
> regulation, as well as to other applicable regulatory authorities,
> will be promptly evaluated and investigated by designated individuals.
> MDRs will be processed according to QP-0021, Medical Device Reporting
> and Recall Procedure, and be maintained separately. Each MDR will
> contain the following information in addition to complaint records:

1.  Patient Information

2.  If the device failed to meet specifications;

3.  If the device was used for treatment;

4.  If the device was used in the reported incident.

> The record of a complaint investigation includes:

1.  The name of the device;

2.  The date the complaint was received;

3.  Unique device identifier (UDI) or universal product code (UPC), and
    > any other device identification(s);

4.  The name, address, and phone number of the complainant;

5.  The nature and details of the complaint;

6.  The dates and results of the investigation;

7.  Any corrective action taken;

8.  Any reply to the complainant.

> Complaints can prompt initiation of CAPAs when they reveal serious or
> systemic issues. Complaint investigations will include a historical
> review and an evaluation to determine the potential impacts to other
> products. Additional actions may be taken as necessary dependent of
> the nature of the complaint. Related risk assessments (FMEAs, etc.)
> will be evaluated and revised as necessary following the investigation
> of a complaint.

1.  **Complainant Information**

> The complainant information is the identification and contact
> information of the party alleging the deficiency. This includes dates
> of the report and incident, name, address, contact information, and
> company affiliation.

1.  **Product Information**

> The product information includes the information necessary to identify
> the product associated with the complaint and includes items such as
> the name of the device, product model number, part number, and serial
> number as applicable.

1.  **Complaint Description**

> This section describes the complaint in detail and should include the
> following information when possible: any injuries resulting from the
> event, any medical interventions required, how the device was being
> used, environment of use, and description of users.
>
> **Good Faith Effort**
>
> A good faith effort shall include three documented contacts to a
> customer to obtain the claimed defective device involved in a
> complaint and additional information related to the complaint. At
> least one of the contacts shall be in contact with personnel at a
> customer site.

1.  **Complaint Investigation**

> The complaint investigation identifies the root causes of a complaint
> and determine if a device malfunctioned. The risk level will be
> assessed according to Appendix A. The level of an investigation will
> commensurate with the determined risk level.
>
> Once all available information is gathered, the Quality Department
> will determine the appropriate actions necessary to address the
> complaint and reply the complainant.
>
> If an investigation is required for a complaint, we target to finish
> investigation within 90 days from the complaint opening date and will
> document rationale if we need to extend.
>
> **MDR Reportability Determination**
>
> Following decision tree is used to determine MDR reportability:

1.  Is there death involved? Yes ☐ No ☐

2.  Is there serious injury involved? Yes ☐ No ☐

3.  Is there a malfunction involved? Yes ☐ No ☐

4.  If answer to 3) is Yes, will it likely cause or contribute to a
    > death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur? Yes ☐ No
    > ☐

> If there is a yes to any of the questions above, file an MDR according
> to QP-0021 MDR procedure.

1.  **Further Actions Taken**

> This section describes any corrective actions taken in response to the
> complaint. This may include issuing a CAPA or SCAR as applicable.
> Rationale shall be documented if no action is taken.

1.  **Reply to Complainant**

> Any communication replied to the complainant shall be attached to the
> Complaint Form.

1.  **Appendix A – Risk Assessment**

> The following risk assessment methodology has been developed utilizing
> principles from ISO 14971. Any Customer Complaint resulting in Serious
> or Critical Severity shall be evaluated as a Risk Category of Major
