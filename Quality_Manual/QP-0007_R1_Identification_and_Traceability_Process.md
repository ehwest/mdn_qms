1.  **Purpose**

> This document defines policies and procedures for identification and
> traceability of product throughout manufacturing and distribution.
> These policies and procedures include product identification,
> traceability, and status identification.

1.  **Scope**

> This procedure applies to all products manufactured, either in-house
> or by contract manufacturer, for distribution. Products produced under
> investigational device exemptions are exempt from this procedure.

1.  **General**

    1.  **Definitions** – N/A

    2.  **Responsibilities**

> **Quality Management** – Quality Management is responsible for the
> implementation and continued compliance with the procedures specified
> in this document and by the regulatory authorities.

1.  **Equipment and Materials** – N/A

2.  **Safety Precautions** – N/A

3.  **Training Requirements** – All Quality Personnel are required to be
    > trained to this procedure and the training documented.

4.  **Record Management** – Final product manufacturing traceability and
    > acceptance records are maintained within the Device History Record
    > (DHR).

5.  **Reference Documents and Materials**

> **21 CFR 820** – FDA Quality System Regulations
>
> **SOR/98-282** – Canadian Medical Device Regulations
>
> **MDR 2017/745** – EU Medical Device Regulation
>
> **MDD 93/42/EEC** – EU Medical Device Directive
>
> **ISO 13485** – Medical Device Quality Management Systems

1.  **Identification and Traceability Procedure**

> The company is responsible for the identification and traceability
> requirements of products manufactured and distributed under the
> company name. These requirements apply to products manufactured within
> the company and those produced by contracted manufacturers.

1.  **Product Identification**

> The final product and all components determined to be significant
> shall be identified throughout the manufacturing process.
> Identification shall be unique and clearly marked on the product,
> where appropriate. Specific identification requirements for each
> product are maintained within the Device History Record.

1.  **Traceability Procedure**

> Traceability records for finished product are specified and maintained
> within the Device History Record. Traceability requirements are
> specific to the device produced and are dependent on the product risk.
>
> Manufacturing records provide documentation of the manufacturing
> processes and assurance the product was built per procedure to
> approved specifications. At a minimum, the following information is
> included on the manufacturing record. Critical components are specific
> to the type of equipment produced and are specified on the
> manufacturing record. Critical Component ID’s are traceable to batch
> records for the manufacturing process of each component.

-   Unique identifiers of final product and components determined to be
    > significant

-   Date of manufacture

-   Employee(s) responsible for manufacture

-   Equipment critical to manufacturing process

-   Quantity manufactured and quantity released for distribution

-   Primary identification label and labeling used for final product

-   Acceptance records

> The acceptance record provides documentation of acceptance activities
> preformed upon completion of all manufacturing of the associated
> device. Acceptance activities are a preapproved set of tests and/or
> reviews utilized to verify the build, operation, and performance of
> each unit prior to release for distribution.

1.  **Status Identification**

> The identification of product status shall be maintained from receipt
> through production and storage to distribution. Any product found to
> be non-conforming shall be identified as such and controls shall be in
> place to quarantine product until appropriate disposition can be
> determined. Product that has passed all acceptance criteria and is
> acceptable for distribution shall be identified and maintained
> separately from product pending acceptance.
>
> Product returned from external parties shall be appropriately labeled
> as to not be confused with product for distribution. This label shall
> remain with the product until the product has been properly
> dispositioned such as refurbishment, destroyed, etc. Refurbished
> product shall be differentiated from distributable product until the
> product has been refurbished and passes all acceptance criteria.
