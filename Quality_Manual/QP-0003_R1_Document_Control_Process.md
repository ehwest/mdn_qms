1.  **Document Control Procedure**

> The procedures described in this document work in conjunction to
> establish a controlled environment in which changes and improvements
> can introduced into the quality systems while mitigating risk and
> ensuring the quality of the products and services provided. The
> Document Control Library is restricted access and only designated
> personnel have the ability to add, remove, or change the contents of
> the databases. The Document Control Administrator maintains a
> Controlled Document Index of all approved documents.

1.  **Document Numbering System**

> Each controlled document is given a unique document identification
> (Doc ID) assigned by the Document Control Admin. This Doc ID is made
> up of an abbreviation for the document type and a four digit number
> separated by a dash. A list of approved document type abbreviations is
> maintained by Doc Control. Examples include QP – <u>Q</u>uality
> <u>P</u>rocedure, SOP – <u>S</u>tandard <u>O</u>perating
> <u>P</u>rocedure, and PS – <u>P</u>roduct <u>S</u>pecification. The
> four digit number follows a consecutive numbering pattern for all
> document types.
>
> Part Numbers have a separate document identification system that is a
> unique five digit code for each part or product. Part number documents
> include drawings, spec sheets, and other product specifying
> documentation.

1.  **Document Standardization and Templates**

> A consistent document format has been established to ensure necessary
> information is included within the document, the documents remain
> legible, and assist the review/approval process. The sections required
> within a document are dependent upon the document type. Existing
> Document Templates are maintained in the Doc Control Library. Doc
> Control Admin will provide templates for all document types as needed.

1.  **Document Change Control Procedure**

> Additions, modifications, and removal of controlled documents are
> managed utilizing the following procedure and recorded on Document
> Change Order (DCO) Form. All introductions, modification, and, removal
> of controlled documents require the completion, review, and approval
> of DCO Form. The information provided in the form is utilized during
> the approval process to ensure the changes are necessary, justified,
> and associated risks are mitigated.
>
> **Section 1-4 – General Information**
>
> These sections provide the general information and identification of
> the document change order. Each section shall be completed by the Doc
> Author as indicated by the form.

> Doc Control Admin utilizing three letters and a consecutive four digit
> numbering scheme separated by a dash (DCO-\#\#\#\#).
>
> **Section 5-6 – Product Disposition and Disposition Details**
>
> The Product Disposition section specifies if the changes will affect
> product and how to incorporate the change, if applicable. Disposition
> Detail is required if Product Disposition is applicable. The details
> shall include information to substantiate the product disposition and
> a plan to implement change with effectiveness checks as necessary.
>
> **Section 7 – Description of Change(s) and Justification**
