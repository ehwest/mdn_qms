requirements

7.5.6 Validation of Processes for Production and Service Provision

The company validates processes for production and service provision where the resulting output cannot be or is not verified by subsequent monitoring or measurement.  This includes any processes where, as a consequence, deficiencies become apparent only after the product is in use or the service has been delivered.  Validation demonstrates the ability of these processes to achieve planned results consistently.  Validation procedures are documented and include, where applicable:
* Defined criteria for review and approval of the processes
* Equipment qualification and qualification of personnel
* Use of specific methods, procedures, and acceptance criteria
* As appropriate, statistical techniques with rational for samples sizes
* Requirement for records and revalidation, including criteria for revalidation
* Software that may affect conformance to requirements
* Records of validation shall be maintained
The company documents procedures for the validation of the application of computer software sued in production and service provision. Such software applications are validated prior to initial use and, as appropriate, after changes to such software or its application.  The specific approach and activities associated with software validation and revalidation are proportionate to the risk associated with the use of the software, including the effect on the ability of the product to conform to specifications.
Records of the results and conclusions of validation and necessary actions from the validation are maintained.

7.5.7 Particular Requirements for Validation of Processes for Sterilization and Sterile Barrier Systems

Preservation shall apply to the constituent parts of a medical device.  We protect product from alteration, contamination, or damage when exposed to expected conditions and hazards during processing, storage, handling, and distribution by designing and constructing suitable packaging and shipping containers and documenting requirements for special conditions needed if packaging alone cannot provide preservation.  If special conditions are required, they shall be controlled and recorded.  

7.6 Control of Monitoring and Measuring Equipment

All monitoring and measurement equipment, comparative references (such as gauges and templates), and test equipment used in the inspection of product, validation of the product, or the validation of production processes are calibrated and maintained within the Calibration Program.  Instruments used for purposes other than product inspections or control of production processes are exempted from the Calibration Program.  Calibration and verification is completed in accordance with documented procedures.

As necessary to ensure valid results, measuring equipment is:
* Calibrated or verified, or both, at specified intervals, or prior to use, against measurement standards traceable to international or national measurement standards.  When no such standard exists, the basis used for calibration or verification shall be recorded.
* Adjusted or re-adjusted as necessary.  Such adjustments or re-adjustments shall be recorded.
* Identified in order to determine it calibration status
* Safeguarded from adjustments that would invalidate the measurement result
* Protected from damage and deterioration during handling, maintenance, and storage.
