            > its containers/wrappers that are related to
            > identification, technical description, and use of the
            > device; labeling excludes shipping documents.

        -   **Final Proof** – The production master or first article
            > sample for a new or revised labeling/packaging item.

    2.  **Responsibilities**

1.  **Procedure**

> The company utilizes the following procedures to ensure labeling
> achieves the required objectives, is manufactured correctly, and meets
> all quality, regulatory, and customer/user requirements. All labeling
> documentation is required to be approved and archived within the
> Document Control Library. Examples of labeling documentation, if
> applicable, may include: Artwork, Proofs, Material Specifications,
> Label Index, Label First Articles, and Labeling Review and Approval
> Forms.
>
> All labeling associated with a product will be documented and
> controlled within the associated Device Master Record (DMR). The
> primary identification label and labeling used for each production
> unit shall be maintained with the Device History Record (DHR).

1.  **Label Content**

> The following information is required to be presented in a legible,
> permanent, and prominent manner on the product labeling. The
> Indications for Use, Directions for Use, and special storage
> conditions may accompany the product (e.g. IFU) if there is
> insufficient space on the outer package label. Specific requirements
> may be imposed by regulatory authorities based upon product risk
> and/or specific product types.

-   The name of the device

-   The name and address of the manufacturer

-   the identifier of the device, including the identifier of any
    > medical device that is part of a system, test kit, medical device
    > group, medical device family or medical device group family;

-   The contents of the package, expressed in terms appropriate to the
    > device

-   The word “Sterile”, device to be sold in a sterile condition;

-   The expiration date of the device, if applicable

-   Indication for Use: unless self-evident, provides the medical
    > conditions, purposes and function of the device, including the
    > performance specifications

-   Directions for Use: full information as to the procedure recommended
    > for achieving the optimum performance of the device, including
    > cautions, warnings, contraindications and possible side effects

-   Any special storage conditions applicable to the device.

    1.  **Label Translations**

> Labels may require translation based upon international distribution.
> Labeling items containing foreign languages require Certifications of
> Translation. These certifications shall be circulated during the
> review and approval process. A list of labeling translations and
> approved regulatory jurisdiction is maintained with the Device Master
> Record (DMR)

1.  **Labeling Change Control**

> The labeling review and approval process is documented on the Labeling
> Review and Approval Form. All new labeling and labeling modifications
> require a completed and approved form prior to implementation. When
> submitting labeling for review, the party responsible for initiating
> the changes shall provide each reviewer with a properly filled out
> approval form and associated documentation including clear
> identification and rationale for all changes. If applicable, proofs
> provided by the vendor shall be submitted along with the form.
> Completed approval forms and attachments are stored and maintained by
> the Quality Department.
>
> For all labeling changes that impact documents with the Document
> Control Library, the initiating party is responsible for ensuring
> updates are completed.

1.  **Labeling Information**

> Section 1 of QF-0004-1 provides background information regarding the
> proposed submission or changes and any documentation that will be
> impacted by the change. This section shall be completed prior to
> submitting to reviewers for approval.
>
> **4.1.2 Review and Approval Process**
>
> The approval process is documented in Section 2 of the Labeling and
> Approval Form. The appropriate parties shall review the changes
> relative to their area of expertise and items to be considered.
> Approval is designated by a signature and date.
>
> External reviews may be required for labeling that is managed by
> external vendors or requires approval by a customer, partner, or
> external party prior to use.
>
> **4.1.3 Reconciliation of Labels**
>
> For labeling changes that render the previous versions invalid, a
> labeling reconciliation shall be completed to ensure the appropriate
> disposition of the previous version of labeling. Label reconciliation
> documentation shall be stored and maintained by the Quality
> Department.

1.  **Labeling First Article Inspection**

> When the first production lot of updated labeling is received, the
> labeling shall be inspected against approved specifications/drawings
> and verified to be correct. Verification documentation along with
> first lot samples, where possible, shall be submitted to the Quality
> Department to be maintained along with the associated QF-0004-1. Where
> physical samples cannot be submitted along for approval, photographs
> or electronic files shall be acceptable.
>
> Products containing new or updated labeling shall not be released for
> distribution until the labeling first article inspection has been
> completed.
