QP-0021|Medical Device Reporting and Recall Process|R 1|9/1/2021|/s/ Ben West

1.  **Purpose**

> This document defines policies and procedures for evaluating,
> executing, and documenting medical device reportable events and
> recalls.

1.  **Scope**

> This procedure applies to all product related information obtained by
> employees that is related to adverse events, recalls, and/or MDR’s.

1.  **General**

    1.  **Definitions**

-   **Adverse Event** – An event that resulted in serious injuries
    > and/or death or a malfunction event that would likely cause or
    > contribute to serious injury if the malfunction were to recur.

-   **Become Aware** – The company is determined to be aware once any
    > employee of the company has acquired information that reasonably
    > suggests a reportable adverse event has occurred.

-   **Incident** – Any malfunction or deterioration in the
    > characteristics and /or performance of a device, as well as any
    > inadequacy in the labeling or in the instructions for use which,
    > directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the
    > death of a patient, or USER or of other persons or to a serious
    > deterioration in their state of health.

-   **Malfunction** – The failure of a device to meet its performance
    > specifications or otherwise perform as intended. Performance
    > specifications include all claims made in the labeling for the
    > device. The intended performance of a device refers to the
    > intended use for which the device is labeled or marketed.

-   **Medical Device Reporting (MDR)** – Reporting of adverse event that
    > reasonably suggest the device may have caused, may cause in the
    > future, or may have contributed to a death or serious injury to
    > regulatory authorities.

-   **Recall** – The correction or removal of a device for human use
    > where there is a reasonable probability that the device would
    > cause serious, adverse health consequences or death.

-   **Serious Deterioration in the State of Health** - a
    > life-threatening disease, disorder or abnormal physical state, the
    > permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a
    > body structure, or a condition that necessitates an unexpected
    > medical or surgical intervention to prevent such a disease,
    > disorder or abnormal physical state or permanent impairment or
    > damage.

-   **Serious Injury** – An injury or illness that is life-threatening,
    > results in permanent impairment of the body function or permanent
    > damage to a body structure, or necessitates medical or surgical
    > intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function
    > or permanent damage to a body structure.

-   **Sold in Canada** – Any device for which the company has a valid
    > medical device license

    1.  **Responsibilities**

> **Quality Management** – Quality Management is responsible for the
> implementation and continued compliance with the procedures specified

1.  **Criteria for Determining Adverse Events and Incidents**

> All events involving distributed medical devices that are associated
> with death or serious injury or the malfunction that is likely to
> cause death or serious injury shall be evaluated via this procedure.
> The information leading to adverse reports may come from customer
> complaints, distributor feedback, external advisory notices, internal
> trending, post-market surveillance, and other sources. Events that
> meet all three of the following criteria shall be deemed reportable to
> the appropriate regulatory authorities.

1.  **Criteria 1 – An event has occurred**

> Events may result from use by customers, testing performed on the
> device and/or new scientific information. Events include, but are not
> limited to:

-   A malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance
    > of the device

-   For IVD’s, false positive or false negative results that fall
    > outside the declared test performance or where could contribute to
    > serious injury.

-   Unanticipated adverse reaction or unanticipated side effect

-   Interactions with other substances or products

-   Degradation/destruction of the device (e.g. fire)

-   Inappropriate therapy

-   An inaccuracy in the labeling, instructions for use and/or
    > promotional materials

    1.  **Criteria 2 – The device is suspected to be a contributory
        > cause**

> In assessing the link between the device and the event, the following
> information shall be considered:

-   The opinion, based on available evidence, of healthcare
    > professionals

-   The results of preliminary assessments of the event

-   Evidence of previous, similar incidents

-   Any other relevant evidence

    1.  **Criteria 3 – The event led, or might have led, to death or
        > serious injury**

> Serious injury can include, but not limited to:

-   Serious deterioration in the state of health

-   Life-threatening illness

-   Permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a
    > body structure

-   A condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to
    > prevent above items

-   Any indirect harm as a consequence of an incorrect diagnostic or IVD
    > test result

-   Foetal distress, foetal death or any congenital abnormality or birth
    > defects

    1.  **Trend Reports**

> Outside of the above criteria, internal trending of data may lead to
> the discovery of adverse trends involving user safety. Upon
> identifying significant increase or trend of events or incidents that
> are usually excluded from the above criteria, a report may be required
> to be filed with the appropriate regulatory authorities. Such trending
> information may come from customer complaints, post-market
> surveillance, medical device reporting, and/or other applicable
> quality systems. See the FDA, MEDDEV, Health Canada, etc. guidance
> documents for additional information regarding trending data that is
> required to be reported.

1.  **Use Error and Abnormal Use**

> For information regarding when it is required to report use error and
> abnormal use events, see the FDA, MEDDEV, Health Canada, etc. guidance
> documents.

1.  **Medical Device Reporting**

> Adverse events and Incidents that meet the criteria listed in the
> section above shall be reported to the regulatory authorities of the
> zones of distribution. Medical Device Reporting shall following this

> above the incident is reportable and an initial report shall be made
> to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Otherwise, the
> investigation is closed and records are filled appropriately.

1.  **Investigation Outcome and Follow-Up**

> All necessary corrective and preventative actions stemming from the
> investigation of an adverse event shall be documented and managed in
> the CAPA System. If through the investigation, it is determined that a
> recall or field safety corrective action is necessary see Recall
> Section below. Progress or Follow-Up reports shall be submitted if the
> investigation and corrective actions exceed the timeline provided on
> the initial report. A Final Report shall be submitted upon the
> completion of all corrective and preventative actions. The Final
