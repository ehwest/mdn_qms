1.  **Process Validation Procedure**

    1.  **Process Validation Decision**

> A process is required to be validated if the output of the process is
> not fully verified by subsequent inspection and testing or
> verification is not sufficient or cost effective. A process may be
> large and/or complex and composed of many sub-processes. Each
> sub-process shall be considered individually as well as part of the
> full process.

1.  **Validation Planning**

> Validation planning is necessary for a successful validation.
> Following is a list of activities which may be considered during the
> validation planning stage.

-   Form multi-functional team for validation

-   Plan the approach and define the requirements

-   Identify and describe the processes

-   Specify process parameters and desired output

-   Decide on verification and/or validation

-   Create a master validation plan

-   Select methods and tools for validation

-   Create validation protocols

-   Perform IQ, OQ, PQ and document results

-   Determine continuous process controls

    1.  **Protocol Development**

> Detailed protocols for performing validations are essential to ensure
> that the process is adequately validated. Process validation protocols
> may consider the following elements:

-   Identification of the process to be validated

-   Identification of device(s) to be manufactured using this process

-   Objective and measurable criteria for a successful validation

-   Length and duration of the validation

-   Shifts, operators, equipment to be used in the process

-   Identification of utilities for the process equipment and quality of
    > the utilities

-   Identification of operators and required operator qualification

-   Relevant specifications that relate to the product, components,
    > manufacturing materials, etc.

-   Process parameters to be monitored, and methods for controlling and
    > monitoring

-   Product characteristics to be monitored and method for monitoring

-   Criteria for revalidation

-   Deviation resolution

> For all three phases, IQ, OQ, and PQ, based on product/process
> requirements:

-   Determine what to verify/measure

-   Determine how to verify/measure

-   Determine how many to verify/measure, i.e. statistical significance

-   Determine when to verify/measure

-   Define acceptance/rejection criteria

-   Define required documentation

    1.  **Installation Qualification**

> The IQ validates that the process and/or equipment is installed
> correctly. IQ considerations include:

-   Equipment design features (i.e. materials of construction
    > cleanability, etc.)

-   Installation conditions (wiring, utilities, functionality, etc.)

-   Calibration, preventative maintenance, cleaning schedules

-   Safety features

-   Supplier documentation, prints, drawings and manuals

-   Software documentation

-   Environmental conditions (such as clean room requirements,
    > temperature, humidity)

    1.  **Operational Qualification**

> During the OQ phase the process parameters should be challenged to
> assure that they will result in a product that meets all defined
> requirements under all anticipated conditions of manufacturing, i.e.,
> worst case testing. During routine production and process control, it
> is desirable to measure process parameters and/or product
> characteristics to allow for the adjustment of the manufacturing
> process at various action level(s) and maintain a state of control.
> These action levels should be evaluated, established and documented
> during process validation to determine the robustness of the process
> and ability to avoid approaching “worst case conditions.”
>
> OQ considerations include:

-   Process control limits (time, temperature, pressure, linespeed,
    > setup conditions, etc.)

-   Software parameters

-   Raw material specifications

-   Process operating procedures

-   Material handling requirements

-   Process change control and training

-   Potential failure modes, action levels and worst-case conditions
    > (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, Fault Tree Analysis)

-   The use of statistically valid techniques such as screening
    > experiments to establish key process parameters and statistically
    > designed experiments to optimize the process can be used during
    > this phase.

    1.  **Performance Qualification**

> In this phase the key objective is to demonstrate the process will
> consistently produce acceptable product under normal operating
> conditions. PQ considerations include:

-   Actual product and process parameters and procedures established in
    > OQ

-   Acceptability of the product

-   Assurance of process capability as established in OQ

-   Process repeatability, long term process stability

> Challenges to the process should simulate conditions that will be
> encountered during actual manufacturing. Challenges should include the
> range of conditions as defined by the various action levels allowed in
> written standard operating procedures as established in the OQ phase.
> The challenges should be repeated enough times to assure that the
> results are meaningful and consistent. A minimum of 3 productions runs
> is required unless otherwise justified. These production runs may be
> shortened as necessary to complete the PQ in a reasonable timeframe.

1.  **Final Report**

> At the conclusion of validation activities, a final report should be
> prepared. This report should summarize and reference all protocols and
> results. It should derive conclusions regarding the validation status
> of the process. The final report should be reviewed and approved by
> the validation team and appropriate management.

1.  **Maintaining a State of Validation**

    1.  **Monitor and Control**

> Trends in the process should be monitored to ensure the process
> remains within the established parameters. When monitoring data on
> quality characteristics demonstrates a negative trend, the cause
> should be investigated, corrective action may be taken and
> revalidation considered.

1.  **Changes in Process and/or Product**

> Any changes in the process and/or product including changes in
> procedure, equipment, personnel, etc. should be evaluated in
> accordance with QP-0009 to determine the effects of those changes and
> the extent of revalidation considered.

1.  **Continued State of Control**

> Various changes may occur in raw materials and/or processes, which are
> undetected, or considered at the time to be inconsequential. These
> changes may cumulatively affect the validation status of the process.
> Periodic revalidation should be considered for these types of
> processes.
