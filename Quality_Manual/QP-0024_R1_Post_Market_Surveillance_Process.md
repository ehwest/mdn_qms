1.  **Purpose**

 This document defines the policies and procedures for post-market
 surveillance activities to gain information regarding the quality,
 safety, and performance of products released for commercial
 distribution.

2.  **Scope**

 This document applies to medical devices that have been released for
 commercial distribution. Products that have not been released for
 distribution are exempt from this procedure.

3.  **General**

3.1  **Definitions**

-   **Surveillance:** The collection of processes and activities used to
     monitor the safety and effectiveness of medical devices, including
     the evaluation of this information.

-   **Post-Market Surveillance:** The pro-active collection of
     information on quality, safety or performance of medical devices
     after they have been placed on the market.

-   **Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF):** Part of the Post-Market
     Surveillance involving monitoring of clinical data to supplement
     or verify the assumptions made in connection with the clinical
     evaluation.

-   **Vigilance:** Systematic procedures for dealing with reporting to
     authorities, issuing of safety messages and enforcement of safety
     related corrective actions for delivered products.

-   **Clinical Data:** Safety and/or performance information that are
     generated from the clinical use of a medical device.

-   **Clinical Evaluation:** The assessment and analysis of clinical
     data pertaining to a medical device to verify the clinical safety
     and performance of the device when used as intended by the
     manufacturer.

3.2.  **Responsibilities**

 **Quality Management** – Quality Management is responsible for the
 implementation and continued compliance with the procedures specified
 in this document and maintaining records.

3.3.  **Equipment and Materials** – N/A

3.4.  **Safety Precautions** – N/A

3.5.  **Training Requirements** – Quality personnel shall be trained to
     this procedure and the training documented.

 **NB-MED/2.12/Rec1**: Post-Marketing Surveillance (PMS)

 **GHTF SG5 (PD) N4R7**: Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up Studies

 **GHTF/SG2/N47R4:** Review of Current Requirements on Post Market
 Surveillance

4.  **Post-Market Surveillance Procedure**

 The inputs identified below define Post-Market Surveillance as
 performed to support international vigilance requirements. Post-Market
 Surveillance data is assessed as part of the Design Control Process
 and Management Review.

4.1.  The company will identify applicable information from the sources
     below in order to be able to gather relevant information regarding
     quality, safety and performance of medical devices which have been
     placed on the market. Surveillance is an ongoing process of
     reviews throughout the life of the device. Information Sources
     include, but are not limited to:

    -   Production Activities

    -   Product quality and product reliability from the field

    -   Relevant CAPA’s

    -   Customer Complaints and MDR’s

    -   Quality Audits (Product Audits)

    -   Information and reports from sales agents and distributors (e.g.
         customer satisfaction)

    -   Reports from medical meetings and trade shows

    -   Available scientific publications related to products

    -   Review of adverse event / vigilance information provided by
         various regulatory agency websites, publications, etc. of both
         manufactured products and similar products from competitors

4.2.  When establishing and documenting Post Market Surveillance, the
     company considers:

    -   Whether the design of the device, the material, the principles
         of operation, the technology, or the medical indication is new

    -   The extent of available scientific knowledge (e.g. on long term
         effects)

    -   The state of the art and market experience with similar products
         and technology

    -   Sensitive target population

    -   Well known risk from the literature and/or of similar marketed
         devices, and

    -   Identification of an acceptable risk during pre-clinical
         evaluation, which should be monitored in a longer term and/or
         through a larger population

3.  The results of the Post-Market Surveillance information gathered
     will be reviewed to determine whether a corrective and preventive
     action needs to be taken in product design, manufacturing,
     labeling and/or training, etc., and to evaluate and determine
     whether regulatory action such as Medical Device Vigilance
     Reporting (EU), advisory notices, recalls and other actions are
     needed. This information shall be evaluated against the risk
     management file to determine if additional actions are necessary.

4.  The review of Post-Market Surveillance summaries, data, information,
     and all actions taken, including the determination that no actions
     are required, will be documented as part of the Post-Market
     Surveillance effort and reviewed during the Management Review
     Process. The review of the Post-Market Surveillance shall include
     a documented assessment of the impacts and updates to any relevant
     Clinical Evaluations.

 Post Market Clinical Follow Up (PMCF) Studies may be required as
 defined below. The determination on when a required PMCF is performed
 is decided by appropriate management.
