        > the project and personnel resources from QA/RA, Engineering,
        > Operations, Sales & Marketing and Finance as needed are
        > assigned to form the core project team.

    2.  The Project Team Leader shall chair individual project team
        > meetings, assigning action items, with completion dates, to
        > the appropriate team members with detailed planning and
        > tracking of tasks.

    3.  As a guidance and tracking tool, the Project teams will utilize
        > the Design Review Phase Checklist to navigate correctly
        > through the phase gated design and development process.

    4.  A NPD Project Plan/Schedule shall be developed by the Project
        > Manager and shall include all key project tasks, individual
        > assignments, major milestones such as Phase completion,
        > overall timeline/product launch estimated target, and expected
        > resources. The NPD Project Plan/Schedule shall be reviewed and

2.  **DESIGN PHASE REVIEW MEETING REQUIREMENTS:**

    1.  Design Phase Review meetings are formal meetings with designated
        > key knowledgeable representatives from a cross section of all
        > disciplines within the company (as applicable to the product),
        > and are intended to update the Leadership Team regarding the
        > project meeting the requirements of the specific phase and
        > gaining approval, or receiving disapproval, to move the
        > project to the next Design Phase.

    2.  The Design Phase Review Checklist is utilized as the agenda for
        > the phase review meetings and the meeting minutes are
        > recorded.

    3.  At each Design Phase Review, each item for the specific phase
        > must be reviewed on the checklist and where possible the link
        > for each document shall be listed on the checklist. If an item
        > is not required for a specific product, a brief justification
        > should be listed on the checklist.

    4.  The Design Review Phase Checklist and meeting minutes are the
        > official records of Design Phase Reviews and shall become part
        > of the Product Design History File (DHF).

    5.  At any point in this process the design project may be
        > terminated or suspended as authorized by the Design Review
        > Board. Reason for termination or suspension shall be recorded
        > in the project Design History File (DHF).
