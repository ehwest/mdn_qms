QP-0014|Calibration and Perventive Maintenance Process|R 1|9/1/2021|/s/ Ben West

1.  **Purpose**

 This document defines the policies and procedures for calibration and
 preventive maintenance (PM) activities. These policies and procedures
 include identification, calibration and preventive maintenance
 procedures, and impact assessment of all tools and equipment
 associated with the calibration and preventive maintenance programs.

2.  **Scope**

 Calibration applies to measurement equipment/tools utilized in
 production and product acceptance activities while preventive
 maintenance applies to any process equipment and infrastructure that
 impact product quality. Any measurement equipment/tools not utilized
 in acceptance activities are exempt from the calibration program. Any
 infrastructure or equipment that does not impact product quality is
 exempt from preventive maintenance.

3.  **General**

3.1  **Definitions** – N/A

3.2  **Responsibilities**

 **Quality** – Quality Management is responsible for the implementation
 and continued compliance with the procedures specified in this
 document and by the regulatory authorities.

3.3  **Equipment and Materials** – N/A

3.4  **Safety Precautions** – N/A

3.5  **Training Requirement** –Quality personnel shall be trained to the
     procedures specified in this document.

3.6  **Record Management** – All Calibration and PM records are managed
     and maintained by the Quality Department.

3.7  **Reference Documents and Materials**

 **21 CFR 820** – FDA Quality System Regulations

 **SOR/98-282** – Canadian Medical Device Regulations

 **MDR 2017/745** – EU Medical Device Regulation

 **MDD 93/42/EEC** – EU Medical Device Directive

 **ISO 13485** – Medical Device Quality Management Systems

 **ISO 10012** – Measurement Management Systems

 **QP-0007** – Identification and Traceability Process

 **QP-0008** – Nonconforming Product Process

4.  **Calibration and Preventive Maintenance Procedure**

 The calibration and preventive maintenance programs utilize the
 following procedures to achieve conformity of product to determined
 requirements. The calibration program includes monitoring and
 measurement equipment/tools needed to provide evidence of product
 conformity to requirements. The PM program includes infrastructure and
 process equipment utilized in the production of product.

 The company document procedures for the validation of the application
 of computer software used for calibration or preventive maintenance.
 Applicable validations are be completed prior to implementation and/or
 after changes to the software or its application. The specific
 approach and activities associated with the software validation and
 revalidation shall be proportionate to the risk associated with the
 use of the software, including the effect on the ability of the
 product to conform to specifications.

4.1  **Identification**

 All equipment, tools, infrastructure, etc included in the calibration
 and preventive maintenance programs shall be assigned a unique
 identification number. These ID numbers are maintained within the
 associated program and utilized to link the item to the required and
 completed activities. Where possible, labels shall be attached the
 items that include the following information:

-   Identification Number

-   Name of Item

-   Date of Last Calibration or PM Activity

-   Due Date of Next Required Activity

4.2   **Calibration and Preventive Maintenance Procedures**

 All calibration and PM activities shall follow documented procedures.
 These procedures are specific to the type of equipment, tool, etc and
 shall include specified intervals for completing calibration or PM
 activities. The intervals shall be adjusted as necessary in response
 to the results of the activities. Calibration activities shall be
 traceable to national or international measurement standards; where
 standards do not exist, the basis for calibration shall be recorded.
 Records of the calibration and PM activities shall be maintained and
 include the equipment identification, date of service, the procedure
 followed, individual that completed the activity, and test/inspection
 data.

 Calibration procedures shall be established to verify the accuracy and
 precision of equipment around the range of values the equipment is
 intended to measure. The preferred methodology includes verifying a
 low, mid, and high point at the range of interest. A minimum of a low
 and high point verification is required for calibration.

 When calibration and/or prevent maintenance activities are completed
 externally, a certificate of calibration and/or PM shall be received,
 reviewed, and approved. All other above requirements and records
 remain applicable.

 In the event an item is found out of specification and cannot be
 returned to working condition, the item shall be removed from
 operation and either scrapped or labeled appropriately to prevent
 inadvertent use. Any necessary adjustments or re-adjustments shall be
 documented.

4.3  **Impact to Product Assessments**

 Any equipment, tool, etc that is found to be out of specification
 during calibration and/or PM activities shall initiate an assessment
 of the validity of the previous measurement results and/or outputs in
 regards to product impact. The assessment and any appropriate actions
 taken shall be completed and recorded within the Nonconforming Product
 Process (QP-0008) and traceable to the Calibration and PM Programs.
