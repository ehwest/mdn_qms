QP-0009|Change Control Process|R 1|9/1/2021|/s/ Ben West

1.  **Purpose**

  This document defines the policies and procedures for controlling and
  implementing changes within the Quality Management System. These
  policies and procedures include engineering changes, labeling and
  packaging changes, and documentation changes.

2.  **Scope**

  This procedure applies to all engineering changes associated with the
  Quality Management System. Design and Development changes are
  documented in the Design Control process until the Design Transfer ECO
  has been completed.

3.  **General**

3.1  **Definitions** – N/A

3.2  **Responsibilities**

  **Quality Management** – Quality Management is responsible for the
  implementation and continued compliance with the procedures specified
  in this document and by the regulatory authorities.

3.3  **Equipment and Materials** – N/A

3.4  **Safety Precautions** – N/A

3.5  **Training Requirement** – Operations, Engineering, and Quality are
      required to be trained to this procedure and the training
      documented.

3.6  **Record Management** – All Engineering Change Orders are managed
      and maintained by the Quality Department.

3.7  **Reference Documents and Materials**

  **21 CFR 820** FDA Quality System Regulations
 
  **ISO 13485** – Medical Device Quality Management Systems
 
  **SOR/98-282** – Canadian Medical Device Regulations
 
  **MDR 2017/745** – EU Medical Device Regulation
 
  **MDD 93/42/EEC** – EU Medical Device Directive
 
  **QP-0002** – Design Control Process
 
  **QP-0003** – Document Control Process
 
  **QP-0006** – Labeling and Packaging Control Process
 
  **QF-0009-1** – Engineering Change Order (ECO) Form
 
  **Attachment 1 –** Engineering Change Order Approval Matrix

4.  **Change Control Procedure**

  The change control process utilizes three separate change control
  processes to effectively manage changes within the Quality Management
  System (QMS) and Design & Development: Engineering Changes, Labeling
  and Packaging Changes, and Documentation Changes. These processes
  interact as depicted below and ensure all aspects of the planned
  change is reviewed, approved, and implemented.

4.1  **Engineering Changes**

  Engineering changes are any changes to the product design and
  development outputs as defined in Doc QP-0002 – Design Control
  Process. Examples include changes to product design specifications,
  software specifications, and manufacturing processes. Depending of the
  scope of the change, engineering changes will spinoff labeling changes
  and/or document changes. An ECO is documented on the Engineering
  Change Order (ECO) Form and includes the following information.
 
  **Engineering Change Description**
 
  This section provides the general information and identification of
  the engineering change order including: Change Initiator, Date of
  Proposal, ECO Number (ECO-\#\#\#\#), and a detailed description of the
  proposed change. The information provided shall be detailed enough to
  accurately describe the scope of the changes and the rationale for
  making the change. Additional documentation should be attached to the
  ECO as necessary.
 
  **Impacts of Change**
 
  This section provides an assessment of the impacts of making the
  proposed changes. Items that are commonly impacted by ECO’s include:
  Validations, Verifications, FMEA’s (Risk Management), Documents,
  Training Requirements, Product Quality, Regulatory Requirements, and
  Product Disposition. Design changes shall be assessed for impact to
  function, performance, usability, safety, risk management, product in
  process, and applicable regulatory requirements regarding the medical
  device and its intended use. These shall be clearly identified on ECO
  Form. Additional documentation should be attached to the ECO as
  necessary. A regulatory assessment shall be included in the impact of
  change.
 
  **Review and Approval Process**
 
  The review and approval process is documented on the Engineering
  Change Order (ECO) Form. Each representative shall review and approve
  the ECO based on their area of expertise. Upon approval, ECO’s remain
  open until all associated changes have been documented and the Quality
  Department signs off on the closure. Any changes or revisions to an
  approved ECO shall be rerouted to the original approvers.

4.2  **Labeling Changes**

  The Labeling and Packaging Control Process is defined in document
  QP-0006. Labeling includes product labels, operating manuals, package
  inserts, packaging graphics, marketing material, etc. Labeling changes
  may occur with or without engineering changes and implementation of
  the changes is designated by the effective date of the resultant
  document changes. The labeling and packaging review and approval
  process is documented on the Labeling Review and Approval Form.

4.3  **Document Changes**

  The Document Control Process is defined in document QP-0003 and
  incorporates all changes made to documents associated with the Quality
  Management System. Document changes may occur independently or as a
  result of engineering and/or labeling changes. Engineering and
  labeling changes are considered complete once all associated document
  changes have been approved.
