# Design Verification Review Results

The following table is a work product of the T1Pal Design Review
undertaken 8/27/2020 by Earle West (VP Systems Engineering)  and Ben West (CEO).
This work product is an enumeration of all of the component services
of T1Pal.com, which itself is a micro-service based design.

The function of each and every component in this T1Pal design is completely
captured by its API as shown in the table below.
Each and every API listed has been the target of either automated tests,
code review, and/or manual testing operations.
