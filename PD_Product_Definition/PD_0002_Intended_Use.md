## T1Pal Definitive List of Intended Use Cases

### REQ_1000 -- Secondary Display
Nightscout receives data from the displays of devices primarily in service of insulin intensive therapy, such as insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitors, connected insulin pens, and glucose meters.  T1Pal provides Nightscout as an alternative, or secondary display, to the displays primarily responsible for dosing decisions.  Nightscout does not provide any remote control of these devices, but rather provides a secondary display of the same information provided on the devices themselves.


### REQ_1010 -- Remote Access
Nightscout provides a secure way for people to share across devices and with people they trust.  The data will only flow to locations authorized by users.  The data includes signals including operational status and provenance of the originating medical device to support accurate and up to date representations of the therapeutic status.


### REQ_1020 -- Documentation Support
It is an intended use of T1Pal to provide documentation/evidence supporting medical device warranty claims, and automated ordering of consumable supplies consistent with the secondary data made available by T1Pal displays.

### REQ_1030 -- Technical Support
It is an intended use of T1Pal to provide "Technical Support" to both patients and followers as may be needed to 
resolve mechanical assembly, power supply, settings, configuration, and/or tests of proper operations related to 
those medical devices configured to provide secondary display capabilities to T1Pal.
Such Technical Support activities shall be provided to T1Pal subscribers using the T1Pal trouble ticketing system
to access helpers having access to their secondary data displays.

Technical Support provided by enrolled T1Pal helpers shall be limited to mechanical assembly, power supply, settings, configurations, and/or tests of proper operation.  No medical guidance, interpretation, or therapy shall be provided by such helpers.  In the event subscribers or followers request medical guidance, interpretation, or therapy, referrals to qualified medical practitioners will be provided.
It is an intended use for patients to share to followers (described in REQ_1000 above) all data and/or notifications of certain device faults, errors, power outages, or other events consistent with missing or bad data delivered by medical devices for the purposes of secondary display of data.
