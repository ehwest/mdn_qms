## T1Pal Definitive List of Intended Use Cases


### REQ_1000 -- Secondary Display
T1Pal receives data from one or more "other" medical devices and provides a secondary 
display for each of those "other" devices, using the same data shown in the respective primary display.

These "other" devices are intended to include devices supporting insulin intensive therapy, including insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitors, connected insulin pens, and glucose meters.  

All data and/or notifications of certain device faults, errors, power outages, or other events 
consistent with missing or bad data delivered by medical devices 
are intended to be included in data displayed in a secondary display.

While "other" devices have primary displays, and in some cases, primary control functions,
access to control functions is not an intended or enabled use of T1Pal. 

### REQ_1010 -- Remote Access

T1Pal provides a secure way for secondary display data to be shared with remotely-located people they trust. 
Such data will only flow to locations authorized by T1Pal users, and may be revoked by the same user.  

It is an intended use for T1Pal users to share their secondary display data with 
one or more remotely-located "followers".

### REQ_1020 -- Documentation Support

It is an intended use of T1Pal to provide documentation/evidence supporting medical
device warranty claims, and automated ordering of consumable supplies consistent with the secondary data made available by T1Pal displays.

### REQ_1030 -- Technical Support
It is an intended use of T1Pal to provide "Technical Support" to both T1Pal users and 
followers as may be needed to hasten the resolution of  
mechanical assembly, power supply, settings, configuration, and/or tests of 
proper operations related to those medical devices configured to provide secondary display capabilities to T1Pal.

Such Technical Support activities shall be provided to T1Pal subscribers using the T1Pal 
trouble ticketing system to access Technical Support "helpers" having specifically authorized access to
secondary data displays.

Technical Support provided by enrolled T1Pal helpers shall be limited to 
mechanical assembly, power supply, settings, configurations, and/or tests of proper operation. 

No medical guidance, interpretation, or therapy shall be provided by such helpers. 

In the event subscribers or followers request medical guidance, interpretation, or therapy, referrals to 
qualified medical practitioners will be provided. 


### REQ_1040
T1Pal is intended to enforce compliance to HIPAA privacy requirements.
