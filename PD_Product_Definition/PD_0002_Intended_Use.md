## T1Pal Definitive List of Intended Use Cases

### REQ_1000 -- Secondary Display
T1Pal is intended to be used to allow "followers" of patients using iCGM,CGM, ACE, Infusion Pumps and/or similar medical devices to observe "secondary displays" of the same data otherwise provided by "primary" displays that are provided with such devices.

### REQ_1010 -- Remote Access
It is an intended use for patients to share to followers (described in REQ_1000 above) all data and/or notifications of certain device faults, errors, power outages, or other events consistent with missing or bad data delivered by medical devices for the purposes of secondary display of data.
Remote access to the data is exclusively intended to monitor the performance and 
current operation of the originating device.

### REQ_1020 -- Documentation Support
It is an intended use of T1Pal to provide documentation/evidence supporting medical device warranty claims, and automated ordering of consumable supplies consistent with the secondary data made available by T1Pal displays.

### REQ_1030 -- Technical Support
It is an intended use of T1Pal to provide "Technical Support" to both patients and followers as may be needed to 
resolve mechanical assembly, power supply, settings, configuration, and/or tests of proper operations related to 
those medical devices configured to provide secondary display capabilities to T1Pal.
Such Technical Support activities shall be provided to T1Pal subscribers using the T1Pal trouble ticketing system
to access helpers having access to their secondary data displays.

Technical Support provided by enrolled T1Pal helpers shall be limited to mechanical assembly, power supply, settings, configurations, and/or tests of proper operation.  No medical guidance, interpretation, or therapy shall be provided by such helpers.  In the event subscribers or followers request medical guidance, interpretation, or therapy, referrals to qualified medical practitioners will be provided.
