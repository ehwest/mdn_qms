# Product Environment Information

This document provides information regarding the environment within which T1Pal is expected to operate.
T1Pal should be understood to be both:

 1. "Medical Device" (an FDA term), and 
 2. "Software "as a service" (SaaS, an Information Technology term)."

A definitive description of the intended use for the T1Pal product is described in PD_2220_Intended_Use.md, within this folder.
Therefore, the information in this file should be understood to interpret those intended uses, and is provided as an aid to understanding the specific intended use statements.
This document should NOT be understood as expanding or adding to the authoritative statements of Intended Use in the referenced document.

T1pal (aka T-one-pal, t1pal.com, T1Pal) is an operating software complex that is entirely
accessed through the Internet for all its purposes and capabilities.  All users of this T1Pal.com software access it 
through the Internet, including administrative users, anonymous users, subscribers, 
security auditors, lawful law enforcement investigators, and maintenance
workers.

T1pal is operated by, and is the product of, Medical Data Networks LLC., and other "partner organizations."
Notably, this includes developers of "Nightscout" project, and multiple open-source software providers.

Copies of the software complex may be deployed in other countries as may
be needed for regulatory purposes.  However, at this writing, all copies
of the software are operated within the United States.

The requirements for T1Pal are intentionally aligned with requirements set forth by the FDA for
"Software as a Medical Device" found in the FDA regulations
[here.](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpcd/classification.cfm?id=668)

One of the purposes of T1Pal is to create notifications to notify another person, a follower, 
of the patient's continuous glucose monitoring system sensor glucose information in real time. 
Therefore, based on the FDA applicable language, T1Pal is a "Continuous Glucose Monitor Secondary Display".
Please see [PD_0002 Intended Use](./PD_Product_Definition/PD_0002_Intended_Use.md) for a definitive 
statement of T1Pal intended use.

The secondary 
display of T1PAL.COM does not replace primary real time continuous glucose monitoring or standard 
home blood glucose monitoring -- for any purpose whatsoever.
The T1Pal product will be labelled appropriately to convey this important principle.

The complete T1Pal software complex is comprised of a number of semi-independent 
components and "micro-services", each installed on 
one or more 3rd party computing systems.

The T1Pal system receives and then creates displays 
of real-time patient data from one or more continuous glucose monitors (CGMs).

In addition to CGM data, however, 
the T1Pal system receives and displays real-time patient data derived from sources other
than a CGM system sensor. 

Specifically, T1Pal also displays secondary display data transmitted by one or more
infusion pump devices, and one or more control processor
(such as the Tidepool Loop controller).

Like the CGM data, pump infusion data (including settings, changes to settings, and faults), and
contoller data (including settings, changes to settings, and faults) also supporting secondary
display of their own data enabled by T1Pal.

It should be noted that ALL of the displays and reports generated by T1Pal are secondary displays
of data, and the patient is expected to refer to primary device displays for any purposes that involve
computing and/or executing any needed therapy.

Consistent with its role as a secondary display, T1Pal.com requires no prescription.

To use the software, consumers must apply for a monthly subscription-based
access to the server complex to receive the benefits of the service.
Subscribers access the service by using any of the following devices:
 + iPhone cell phone with an interent data service plan
 + Androidcell phone with an internet  data service plan
 + desktop or laptop PC with Firefox browser and Internet connectivity

T1Pal is intended to comply with the FDA definition of 
[Software as a Medical Device](https://www.fda.gov/media/119722/download)
