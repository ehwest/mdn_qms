# T1 Pal Privacy Policy
# EFFECTIVE October 1, 2021

Your information and your privacy are important — to you and to us. This policy explains how we use your information and how we keep it safe.

# When This Policy Applies
This Privacy Policy (Policy) covers the information generated when you use or subscribe to any and all  products, services, apps, websites or networks of Medical Data Networks, LLC (DBA:  MDN, T1Pal, CoPilot) to which this policy is linked. In the policy, we call them Products or Services for short.

This Policy applies to you and anyone who uses our Products or Services under your account, except where we identify for you that separate MDN privacy policies or terms and conditions apply.

# You Are Responsible 

You are responsible for making sure all users under your account understand and agree to this Policy.

Here are special circumstances where this Policy may not apply, or may apply in addition to other policies:

Some of our Products or Services – for example the MDN Nightscout service rely on transmitting and/or receiving information to other products or services not operated by MDN. Our privacy policy does not cover those products or services not operated by MDN.

* Some areas both inside and outside of the United States - for example California and the European Union - require us to adopt different policy terms and commitments in accordance with local laws.

* In certain cases, when you are using your MDN Products or Services, other companies may be collecting information, so that your information may be covered by this Policy and other privacy policies at the same time.  For example, if you purchase one of our Products or Services from a distributor or medical clinic, and/or if you use our services to connect to a social networking service, and/or if you provide your information to another company through a co- branded website, app or service controlled by the other company. In each such case, any information you provide to those companies may be subject to just their policy, or subject to both their policy and ours.

* If you are an MDN medical affiliate and/or a business customer, we may have written Product or Service agreements that contain specific provisions about confidentiality, security or handling of information. When one of those agreements differs from or conflicts with this Policy, the terms of those agreements will apply instead.
