 Preventive Action Process). If the retention time is not specified,
 the retention time shall default to five (5) years.

4.2.  **Record Management**

 All quality system records are required to be readily identifiable and
 legible. Identification of records is achieved utilizing a unique
 identifier for each record. The record identification is defined
 within the associated procedure. If the identification is not defined,
 the default ID is comprised of a 2 to 4 letter identifier of the
 process (i.e. SCAR, NCR, CAPA, etc) and a 4 digit number (i.e. 0001,
 0002, etc).

 Records shall be completed in a manner that is legible to all
 necessary parties. All corrections to records shall be made by a
 single line through item needed modification, followed by the
 correction and the initials and date of the person making the change.

4.3  **Record Controls**

 All quality system records are stored with appropriate protection and
 retrievable by with Quality Department. All records (physical and
 electronic) are stored and organized by the associated processes and
 the numeric identifier assigned to the record. Physical records are
 maintained under lock and key in fireproof storage. Electronic records
 are maintained on the company server under access rights protection
 and routine server backups.

 Records that require disposition shall be destroyed. Physical records
 shall be shredded and electronic records permanently deleted from the
 company server.
