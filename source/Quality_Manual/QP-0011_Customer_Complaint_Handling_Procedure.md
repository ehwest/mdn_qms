## 4.  **Customer Complaint Handling Procedure**

 This procedure guides the complaint handling process including
 receiving, reviewing, and evaluating customer complaints by a formally
 designated staff. This procedure ensures that:

1.  All complaints are processed in a uniform manner and reviewed within
     two days after receiving them to determine reportability based
     upon MDR requirements;

2.  Verbal complaints are documented upon receipt;

3.  Complaints are evaluated to determine whether they represent
     reportable events as defined by MDR requirements and applicable
     regulations;

4.  All complaint investigations are completed within 15 days unless
     otherwise documented with appropriate rationale.

5.  Customer complaints are trended.

 A customer complaint may be received by any employee and is documented
 on the Customer Complaint Form (QF-0011-1). Each complaint is reviewed
 and investigated by quality staff. Complaints involving possible
 failure of a device, labeling, or packaging will be reviewed and
 investigated, unless such investigation has already been performed for
 a similar complaint. Where no investigation is necessary, a rationale
 will be documented along with decision maker’s name.

 Complaints representing events which must be reported to FDA under MDR
 regulation, as well as to other applicable regulatory authorities,
 will be promptly evaluated and investigated by designated individuals.
 MDRs will be processed according to QP-0021, Medical Device Reporting
 and Recall Procedure, and be maintained separately. Each MDR will
 contain the following information in addition to complaint records:

1.  Patient Information

2.  If the device failed to meet specifications;

3.  If the device was used for treatment;

4.  If the device was used in the reported incident.

 The record of a complaint investigation includes:

1.  The name of the device;

2.  The date the complaint was received;

3.  Unique device identifier (UDI) or universal product code (UPC), and
     any other device identification(s);

4.  The name, address, and phone number of the complainant;

5.  The nature and details of the complaint;

6.  The dates and results of the investigation;

7.  Any corrective action taken;

8.  Any reply to the complainant.

Complaints can prompt initiation of CAPAs when they reveal serious or
systemic issues. Complaint investigations will include a historical
review and an evaluation to determine the potential impacts to other
products. Additional actions may be taken as necessary dependent of
the nature of the complaint. Related risk assessments (FMEAs, etc.)
will be evaluated and revised as necessary following the investigation
of a complaint.

### 4.1  **Complainant Information**

 The complainant information is the identification and contact
 information of the party alleging the deficiency. This includes dates
 of the report and incident, name, address, contact information, and
 company affiliation.

### 4.2  **Product Information**

 The product information includes the information necessary to identify
 the product associated with the complaint and includes items such as
 the name of the device, product model number, part number, and serial
 number as applicable.

### 4.3  **Complaint Description**

 This section describes the complaint in detail and should include the
 following information when possible: any injuries resulting from the
 event, any medical interventions required, how the device was being
 used, environment of use, and description of users.

 **Good Faith Effort**

 A good faith effort shall include three documented contacts to a
 customer to obtain the claimed defective device involved in a
 complaint and additional information related to the complaint. At
 least one of the contacts shall be in contact with personnel at a
 customer site.

### 4.4  **Complaint Investigation**

 The complaint investigation identifies the root causes of a complaint
 and determine if a device malfunctioned. The risk level will be
 assessed according to Appendix A. The level of an investigation will
 commensurate with the determined risk level.

 Once all available information is gathered, the Quality Department
 will determine the appropriate actions necessary to address the
 complaint and reply the complainant.

 If an investigation is required for a complaint, we target to finish
 investigation within 90 days from the complaint opening date and will
 document rationale if we need to extend.

 **MDR Reportability Determination**

 Following decision tree is used to determine MDR reportability:

1.  Is there death involved? `Yes/No`

2.  Is there serious injury involved? `Yes/No`

3.  Is there a malfunction involved? `Yes/No`

4.  If answer to 3) is Yes, will it likely cause or contribute to a
     death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur? `Yes/No`

 If there is a yes to any of the questions above, file an MDR according
 to QP-0021 MDR procedure.

### 4.5  **Further Actions Taken**

 This section describes any corrective actions taken in response to the
 complaint. This may include issuing a CAPA or SCAR as applicable.
 Rationale shall be documented if no action is taken.

### 4.6  **Reply to Complainant**

 Any communication replied to the complainant shall be attached to the
 Complaint Form.

## 5.  **Appendix A – Risk Assessment**

 The following risk assessment methodology has been developed utilizing
 principles from ISO 14971. Any Customer Complaint resulting in Serious
 or Critical Severity shall be evaluated as a Risk Category of Major

### 5.1 **Severity Assessment**

Severity Index|Severity Category|Description of Severity
--------------|-----------------|-----------------------
S1|None|No safety concerns and minimal to no impact on quality or product or service.
S2|Minor|Customer annoyed and/or insignificant injury
S3|Moderate|Loss of efficacy and/or significannt injury
S4|Serious|Significant injury that is epected to result in permanent impairment, even with major medical intervention.
S5|Critical|Severe injury where major medical intervention is required to prevent loss of life or when loss of life cannot be prevented.

### 5.2  **Probability of Occurrence Assessment**

Probability Index|Rate of Failure
-----------------|--------------
P1| < 0.01%
P2|0.01% - 0.10%
P3|0.11% - 1.00%
P4|1.01% - 10.00%
P5|> 10.00%

5.3  **Risk Assessment**

Risk Index R = s x p|Risk Category
--------------------|-------------
R1 to R6 | Minor
R8 to R10 | Moderate
R12 to R25 | Major
