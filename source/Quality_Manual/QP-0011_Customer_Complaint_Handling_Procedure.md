effectiveness, or performance of a device following
release for distribution.

*  **Malfunction**
The failure of a device to meet its
performance specifications or otherwise perform as
intended. Performance specifications include all claims
made in the labeling for the device. The intended
performance of a device refers to the intended use for
which the device is labeled or marketed.

* **Serious Injury**
An injury or illness that is
life-threatening, results in permanent impairment of the

implementation and continued compliance with the procedures specified
in this document and by the regulatory authorities.

trained to the procedures specified in this document. All
employees shall be made aware of their responsibility to report
customer complaints to the Quality Department.

## Record Management
All Customer Complaints are managed and
maintained by the Quality Department.

## Reference Documents and Materials

## Customer Complaint Handling Procedure

This procedure guides the complaint handling process including
receiving, reviewing, and evaluating customer complaints by a formally
designated staff. This procedure ensures that:

* All complaints are processed in a uniform manner and reviewed within two days after receiving 
them to determine reportability based upon MDR requirements;

* Verbal complaints are documented upon receipt;

* Complaints are evaluated to determine whether they represent reportable events as defined by MDR requirements and applicable regulations;

* All complaint investigations are completed within 15 days unless
     otherwise documented with appropriate rationale.

* Customer complaints are trended.
A customer complaint may be received by any employee and is documented
on the Customer Complaint Form (QF-0011-1). Each complaint is reviewed
and investigated by quality staff. Complaints involving possible
failure of a device, labeling, or packaging will be reviewed and
investigated, unless such investigation has already been performed for
a similar complaint. Where no investigation is necessary, a rationale
will be documented along with decision maker’s name.

Complaints representing events which must be reported to FDA under MDR
regulation, as well as to other applicable regulatory authorities,
will be promptly evaluated and investigated by designated individuals.
MDRs will be processed according to QP-0021, Medical Device Reporting
and Recall Procedure, and be maintained separately. Each MDR will
contain the following information in addition to complaint records:

* Patient Information

* If the device failed to meet specifications;

* If the device was used for treatment;

* If the device was used in the reported incident.

*  The record of a complaint investigation includes:
   * The name of the device;
   * The date the complaint was received;
   * Unique device identifier (UDI) or universal product code (UPC), and any other device identification(s);
   * The name, address, and phone number of the complainant;
   * The nature and details of the complaint;
   * The dates and results of the investigation;
   * Any corrective action taken;
   * Any reply to the complainant.

Complaints can prompt initiation of CAPAs when they reveal serious or
systemic issues. Complaint investigations will include a historical
review and an evaluation to determine the potential impacts to other
products. Additional actions may be taken as necessary dependent of
the nature of the complaint. Related risk assessments (FMEAs, etc.)
will be evaluated and revised as necessary following the investigation
of a complaint.

## Complainant Information

The complainant information is the identification and contact
information of the party alleging the deficiency. This includes dates
of the report and incident, name, address, contact information, and
company affiliation.

### Product Information

The product information includes the information necessary to identify
the product associated with the complaint and includes items such as
the name of the device, product model number, part number, and serial
number as applicable.

### Complaint Description

This section describes the complaint in detail and should include the
following information when possible: any injuries resulting from the
event, any medical interventions required, how the device was being
used, environment of use, and description of users.

 A good faith effort shall include three documented contacts to a
 customer to obtain the claimed defective device involved in a
 complaint and additional information related to the complaint. At
 least one of the contacts shall be in contact with personnel at a
 customer site.

### Complaint Investigation

The complaint investigation identifies the root causes of a complaint
and determine if a device malfunctioned. The risk level will be
assessed according to Appendix A. The level of an investigation will
commensurate with the determined risk level.

Once all available information is gathered, the Quality Department
will determine the appropriate actions necessary to address the
complaint and reply the complainant.

If an investigation is required for a complaint, we target to finish
investigation within 90 days from the complaint opening date and will
document rationale if we need to extend.

 **MDR Reportability Determination**

Following decision tree is used to determine MDR reportability:

* Is there death involved? `Yes/No`

* Is there serious injury involved? `Yes/No`

* Is there a malfunction involved? `Yes/No`

  * If answer to 3) is Yes, will it likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur? `Yes/No`
  *If there is a yes to any of the questions above, file an MDR according
 to QP-0021 MDR procedure.

### Further Actions Taken

This section describes any corrective actions taken in response to the
complaint. This may include issuing a CAPA or SCAR as applicable.
Rationale shall be documented if no action is taken.

### Reply to Complainant

Any communication replied to the complainant shall be attached to the Complaint Form.

## Risk Assessment Methodology

The following risk assessment methodology has been developed utilizing
principles from ISO 14971. Any Customer Complaint resulting in Serious
or Critical Severity shall be evaluated as a Risk Category of Major

### Severity Assessment

Severity Index|Severity Category|Description of Severity
--------------|-----------------|-----------------------
S1|None|No safety concerns and minimal to no impact on quality or product or service.
S2|Minor|Customer annoyed and/or insignificant injury
S3|Moderate|Loss of efficacy and/or significannt injury
S4|Serious|Significant injury that is epected to result in permanent impairment, even with major medical intervention.
S5|Critical|Severe injury where major medical intervention is required to prevent loss of life or when loss of life cannot be prevented.

### Probability of Occurrence Assessment

Probability Index|Rate of Failure
-----------------|--------------
P1| < 0.01%
P2|0.01% - 0.10%
P3|0.11% - 1.00%
P4|1.01% - 10.00%
P5|> 10.00%

###  Risk Assessment

Risk Index R = s x p|Risk Category
--------------------|-------------
R1 to R6 | Minor
R8 to R10 | Moderate
R12 to R25 | Major
