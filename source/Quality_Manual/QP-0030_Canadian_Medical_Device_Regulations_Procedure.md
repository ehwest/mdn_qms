         MDSAP audits including the specific regulatory requirements of
         Canada.

             substantial changes to the QMS or where the product range
             covered by the scope of registration will be revised.

         medical devices (Classes I, II, III and IV).

         license prior to the import or sale of a new (or significantly

        -   If required, the company will submit requested documentation
             that helps support that product to be licensed meets
             appropriate safety and efficacy requirements.

            -   As required, device instructions will be made available
                 in English and/or French

        -   The company will confirm the accuracy of product
             documentation for actively distributed products with
             Health Canada during annual renewal of medical device
             licenses.

4.4.  The QMR will submit the necessary documentation (data and forms)
         to meet the scope of the Canadian regulatory requirements for
         medical devices. The company has included requirements for
         compliance to the Canadian Device Regulations in our Quality
         System Procedures for Complaint Handling, Medical Device
         Reporting, Product Recall (Vigilance), Post Market
         Surveillance and other procedures required for compliance to
         the CMDR.
