# Introduction

## Purpose

This document provides a complete overview of the Quality Management System (QMS) used by Medical Data Networks LLC. to deliver operating "T1Pal"and "CoPilot" software applications
that run "ïn the cloud."

Because these are entirely operating software applications, we rely on the FDA's characterization of these kinds of things
as "devices" for which numerous regulations apply.

[FDA Rules](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/classify-your-medical-device/class-i-ii-exemptions)
say that all medical devices are subject to the Quality System Regulation (21 CFR 820),
also referred to as the
“Current Good Manufacturing Practices” or “Good Manufacturing Practices,”
unless there is an exception or exemption noted in 21 CFR 820.

This Quality Management System is fully intended to comply with the following domestic and international regulations and standards:

* Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 21, Food and Drug
* 21 CFR Part 820 – Quality System Regulation
* ISO 13485 – Medical Devices – Quality Management Systems
* EU Medical Device Regulation – MDR 2017/745
* EU Medical Device Directive – MDD 93/42/EEC
* Other regulatory authorities as appropriate

The contents of a coherent set of files that contain
baselined procedures, templates, and operating records
are strictly managed by change-control procedures, and make this QMS work.

This QMS is made of these types of files.

1. Files describing procedures that shall be used by the QMS (QP prefix).
2. Files containing templates used by procedures (QF prefix)
3. Files Containing filled-in templates (i.e. operational records) (QR-prefix)

All of these marked down files are managed in a collection of files and folders hosted
on this github repository: [github.com:ehwest/mdn-qms](https://github.com:ehwest/mdn-qms).
This mark-down form of the QMS source enables a variety of rendered formats that
contain the same content.

The authoritative source of all QMS information is in this document 
is found here:  [QM-0001](QM-0001_Quality_Manual.md).

This [Quality Manual](./QM-0001_Quality_Manual.md) provides links to other files in the folder and provides
an overview of all of the files within the MDN QMS.
With the same Quality_Manual folder, we store the process descriptions for each of
30 distinct Quality Procedures.

In a separate "Quality_Manual_Forms" folder, one may find blank templates for capturing Quality Process records.
In yet another "Quality_Manual_Records" folder, Quality Records are kept (unless otherwise specified.

Here is a list of all of the Quality System procedures together with a link to the .md content file.

# Quality System Requirements

## Product Definition, Design, Development, and Validation.

This QMS includes "Product Definition", "Product Design", "Development", and "Validation"."
sections as needed to convey how cloud-based operating software services (FDA "devices")  "T1Pal" and "CoPilot" are created, delivered, and validated consistent with applicable rules.

## Alignment With Rules

The present Quality Management System (QMS) is specifically designed to achieve and sustain the alignment of MDN 
services and/or software "devices" to applicable rules.
The applicable rules are:

1. Registration of T1Pal and CoPilot with the FDA
2. Meet FDA-defined "Special Controls" for T1Pal and CoPilot Operations
3. Support "Appropriate Validations" for T1Pal and CoPilot as "devices".
4. Implement certain "Special Controls" needed to sustain T1Pal Operations.

In this environment, **"Special Controls"** has been defined by the FDA as follows:

    A. Devices must protect against unauthorized access to and modification of data.

    B. Device labeling must display the following warnings and limitations: 

        1.  **Dosing decisions should not be made based on this device.**
  
        2.  **The user should follow instructions on the continuous glucose monitoring system.**
  
        3.  **This device is not intended to replace self-monitoring practices advised by a physician.**

## Change Control

The change control mechanism built into the QMS system, particularly the
github repository service, enables all users of the Quality Management System data procesing tools to determine whether or not they have an exact copy of all of the applicable documents. 
It also enables convenient read-only access to all incremental changes to any file that is part of the Quality Management System electronic record set. 
This ensures compliance with FDA Part 11 regulations for audit trail capabilities.


Each and every one of the Quality System folder names and the files within each such folder, and their links to other specific QMS folders within the Quality Management System repository,  altogether completely describe the Medical Data Networks LLC Quality Management System.  

The integrity and traceability of all changes to the Quality Management system is maintained in a "git" repository having its document root located here:  https://github.com/ehwest/mdn_qms. It should be noted that the "master" branch of this repository is the current operational repository of the QMS.  Other branches may be used to draft and test changes to the QMS, but are not further described within the QMS.

As such, all documents and artifacts that are part of the Quality Management System are subject to change-control procedures such that each and every change to the Quality Management System documentation is tracked by explicit versioning enforced by the git repository system.


It is the responsibility of all employees, contractors and departments at Medical Data Networks to adhere to this QMS.

The Medical Data Networks, LLC quality system has been established, documented, implemented, and maintained to ensure the products and services produced meet the quality standards of the organization and are in compliance with relevant regulatory bodies.  Our organization has applied a risk based approach to the control of the appropriate processes needed for the Quality Management Sytstem (QMS).

The Quality Management System is defined through a four level hierarchy:

* **Quality Manual:** _(This document is the Quality Manual)_ A First-level document that provides a general overview of the Quality System and defines the Quality Policy. 

* **Quality Policies and Procedures:** Second-level documents that provide more detailed explanation of the Quality System clauses and detail the structure of the Quality System.  A collection of pointers to Quality Procedures is provided in Appendix (chapter 3).

* **Standard Operating Procedures and Work Instructions** (sometimes referred to as  "Run Books"): Third-level documents that provide step-by-step instructions on how activities are to be carried out and the requirements of products produced.  These detailed documents are maintained separately on the Quality Management change control system, a git repository.
Each of the Quality Management system process descriptions points to one or more "Run Books" in the git repository.

* **Forms and Records:** Fourth-level documents or data that contain the information, charts, checklists, or other form of records as evidence to demonstrate conformance to specified requirements and the effective operation of the Quality System.
The Quality System Process documents point to folders that contain both templates and records of Quality System events.

If a particular development project or customer request cannot be fulfilled by the existing procedures, quality plans are created to ensure that the specific requirements are met.  Quality plans are consistent with all other requirements of the Quality System.  Consideration shall be given to the resources or skills required to meet specified requirements whenever there is a significant change to an existing product, process, test, inspection, verification, and measurement.
	
The following key processes and interactions define the organizational structure and responsibilities of the Quality Management System.

necessary, to ensure the proper implementation of the procedures.
Procedures and records may be created and/or maintained in the form of
paper copy, electronic copy, or in other media as deemed appropriate.

Records of contracts, contract reviews, proposals and contract amendments are maintained in the customer file.

## Customer Communication

The company plans and documents effective arrangements for communicating with customers in relation to:

* Product information
* Inquiries, contracts, and order handling, including amendments
* Customer feedback, including customer complaints, and customer satisfaction
* Advisory notices
We have documented procedures for communicating with regulatory authorities in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements

## Design and Development

Documented procedures shall be used to control and verify the development of new products to ensure that the specified requirements are met.  

All of the products of MDN are currently defined entirely by software. In addition,
all of the supporting integrated services, data structures, and infrastructure component services are also
defined by software, and managed using configuration files.

Supporting this all-software approach to developing products, an "agile" process that implements "continuous integration"  and "çontinuous delivery" has been established
for all products developed by MDN.  

It should be noted that the goal of the original product release was to deliver
a "Minimum Viable Product (MVP)" that represents a minimal set of features that all meet the customer expectations and requirements (including any regulatory requirements).

Following the delivery of the MVP, subsequent small (i.e. agile) releases would be expected to rapidly deliver new and improved capabilities (i.e. "as if" the process were continuous).

### Design and Development Inputs

Design input requirements relating to the product are identified, documented, and reviewed for adequacy.  Design input requirements include:

* Functional, performance, usability, and safety requirements, according to its intended use

* Applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and standards

* Applicable output(s) of risk management

* As appropriate, information derived from previous similar designs

* Other requirements essential for design and development of the product and processes

Design input requirements are reviewed for adequacy and incomplete, ambiguous, or conflicting requirements are resolved.  Requirements shall be complete, unambiguous, able to be verified or validated, and not in conflict with each other.

###  Design and Development Outputs

Design outputs are provided in a form suitable for verification against design input and are approved prior to release.  Design outputs:

* Demonstrate that input requirements have been met

* Provide appropriate information for purchasing and production

* Contain or reference product acceptance criteria

* Specify product characteristics essential for its safe and proper use

###  Design and Development Review

The design control procedure requires that systematic design and development reviews be conducted to:

* Evaluate the ability of the design to meet the requirements

* Provide for a review by participants representing concerned functions as well as other specialized personnel

* Identify any deficiencies and propose necessary actions 

Participants in these reviews include representative from relevant functional areas and specialist personnel, concerned with the design stage being reviewed.

Records of the results of design reviews and any necessary actions are maintained and include the identification of the design under review, the participants involved and the date of the review.

It is the responsibility of all personnel to keep records of all work
or operations performed in the format prescribed by the various
policies and procedures in the quality system. All records shall
contain the date of creation and the person responsible for their
creation. All records shall be made in a permanent and legible manner
and changes to a record shall remain identifiable. Controls necessary
for the identification, storage, protection, retrieval, retention
time, and disposition of records shall be included within the
documented procedure requiring the record. Methods for protecting
confidential health information contained in records shall be defined
and implemented.

Management is responsible for establishing a custodian of all quality
records, including internal audits, management reviews, corrective
actions, preventive actions, training records, proficiency test
results, and other related records. The record retention time is
specified by relevant regulatory requirements or documented
 procedures, whether hard copy or electronic.

###  Design and Development Verification

Design and development verification is performed in accordance with planned and documented arrangements to ensure that design outputs comply with design input requirements.
The company documents verification plans that include methods, acceptance criteria and, as appropriate, statistical techniques with rational for sample size.

If the intended use requires that the medical device be connected to, or have an interface with, other medical device(s), verification shall include confirmation that the design outputs meet design inputs when so connected or interfaced.

Management demonstrates its commitment to the development and
implementation of the Quality Management System, and its continual
improvement, by:

* Communicating to the organization the importance of complying with customer, regulatory, and statutory requirements as applicable

* Creating records of the results and conclusions of design verification and any necessary actions.

###  Design and Development Validation

Design validation is performed in accordance with planned and documented arrangements to ensure that the design is capable of meeting the requirements for the specified application or intended use, where known.  

The company documents validation plans that include methods, acceptance criteria and, as appropriate, statistical techniques with rationale for sample size.

As part of design and development validation, the organization shall perform clinical evaluation or performance evaluations of the medical device in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  A medical used for clinical evaluation or performance evaluation is not considered to be released for use to the customer.

If the intended use requirement that the medical device be connected to, or have an interface with, other medical device(s), validation shall include confirmation that the requirements for the specified application or intended use have been met when so connected or interfaced.

Validation will be performed prior to the release for use of the product to the customer

Records of the results and conclusions of design validation and any necessary actions are maintained.

###  Design and Development Transfer

Design transfer is performed in accordance with planned and documented arrangements to ensure the transfer of design and development outputs to manufacturing.  These procedures ensure that design and development outputs are verified as suitable for manufacturing before becoming final production specification and that production capability can meet production requirements.

Records and conclusions of the results of design validation and any necessary actions are maintained.

###  Control of Design and Development Changes

Design changes and modifications are identified, documented, reviewed, and approved by appropriate management prior to implementation.  The company determines the significance of the change to function, performance, usability, safety, and applicable regulatory requirements for the medical device and its intended use.

Design and development changes are identified and before implementation, the changes are reviewed, verified, validated (as appropriate), approved.

The review of design and development changes shall include evaluation of the effect of the changes on constituent parts and product in process or already delivered, inputs or outputs of risk management, and product realization processes.

The company has identified the following Quality Objectives. These
objectives will be reviewed and updated as necessary to meet company
goals.

-   Establish and maintain a team-oriented working environment in which
    each employee accepts responsibility for the development,
    production, and delivery of high quality goods and services.

-   Implement and maintain a Quality System compliant with the Quality
    System Requirements of the United States Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA), ISO 13485, European Union, and any other
