QP-0025|Unique Device Identification Process|R 1|9/1/2021|/s/ Ben West

1.  **Purpose**

 This document defines the policies and procedures for implementing and
 maintaining unique device identification. This contains the procedures
 and requirements for maintaining compliance to the UDI requirements.

2.  **Scope**

 This procedure applies to all medical devices that are manufactured,
 labeled, and/or distributed by the company.

3.  **General**

3.1.  **Definitions**

        -   **DI** – Device Identifier

        -   **EUDAMED** – European Union Database on Medical Devices

        -   **GMDN** – Global Medical Device Nomenclature

        -   **PI** – Production Identifier

        -   **UDI** – Unique Device Identification

3.2.  **Responsibilities**

 **Regulatory Affairs** – Regulatory Affairs Management is responsible
 for ensuring continued compliance with the procedures specified in
 this document and by the regulatory authorities.

3.3.  **Equipment and Materials** – N/A

3.4. **Safety Precautions** – N/A

3.5.  **Training Requirement** –Regulatory personnel shall be trained to
     this document based upon their responsibilities.

3.6.  **Record Management** – UDI Records are managed and maintained by
     the Regulatory Department for a minimum of five (5) years
     following the last manufacturer of the associated medical device.

3.7.  **Reference Documents and Materials**

 **FDA CFR 21 Part 830** – Unique Device Identification

 **FDA Guidance** – Global Unique Device Identification Database
 (GUDID)

 **MDR 2017/745** – EU Medical Device Regulation

 **MDD 93/42/EEC** – EU Medical Device Directive

 **ISO/IEC 15417 –** Information Technology – Automatic Identification
 and Data Capture Techniques – Code 128 Bar Code Symbology
 Specification

4.  **Unique Device Identification (UDI) Procedure**

4.1.  **UDI Issuing Agency**

 The company utilizes an accredited issuing agency to establish a
 unique company code for UDI. The company has registered with this
 agency and obtained an appropriate company code to identify all
 products produced and distributed.

4.2.  **UDI Components**

 The Unique Device Identification system utilized includes two
 components: the Device Identifier and the Production Identifier. When
 incorporated into barcode format, these may be separated into two
 barcodes or concatenated into a single barcode.

4.2.1  **Device Identifier (DI)**

 The Device Identifier identifies the specific device or device family
 that is produced by the company and contains the following components:

-   Company Code

-   Product Code or Reference Code

-   Unit of Measure (Packaging Configuration identifier)

4.2.2  **Production Identifier (PI)**

 The Production Identifier identifies the specific production lot from
 which the product was manufactured. The PI contains all the following
 information that appears on the product label. Examples include, but
 are not limited to:

-   Lot or Batch Number

-   Serial Number

-   Expiration Date

-   Manufacturing Date

5.  **Barcodes**

 The company utilizes the following specifications to ensure proper
 readability of barcodes on distributed products:

-   Code 128 Symbology

-   Human Readability Version below Barcode

-   Minimum Print Quality of C/06/660

-   Minimum X-dimension of 0.010 inch (0.25mm) at print quality of
     C/06/660

-   Minimum X-dimension of 0.0067 inches (0.17mm) at print quality of
     B/06/660 or better

-   Barcode Height = 5mm or 15% of Total Width of Barcode

-   Each barcode contains a Unit of Measure from 0 to 9 (0 – Individual
     Product, 1 – Smallest Container of Individual Products, etc.)

6.  **Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID) and European
    Database on Medical Device (EUDAMED)**

 The company has established and maintains a GUDID account with the FDA
 and EUDAMED account (when operational) with the EU for applicable
 products. The Regulatory Affairs has the following responsibilities
 associated with these accounts:

-   Ensuring the information submitted to the accounts is accurate and
     up-to-date.

-   Establishing a Regulatory Contact

-   Assigning Labelers, Coordinators, and Data Entry Users as necessary.

 The Device Identifier for each medical device that is distributed in
 the USA is listed in the GUDID. The DI for each medical device with a
 CE Mark is listed in the EUDAMED. Only the DI is listed; the
 Production Identifier is not listed in the GUDID. The Device
 Identifier shall contain the smallest Unit of Measure associated with
 the product. The DI is maintained throughout the product life cycle.
 Once a product life cycle is ended, the Discontinue Date is entered
 into the system.

 The following information is entered in the GUDID and EUDAM as
 applicable. For additional information on how to enter information
 into the system see the FDA GUDID Guidance document.

-   Primary Device Identifier – The Base Package DI

-   Package Information

    -   Package DI

    -   Qty per Package

    -   Contains DI Package

    -   Package Type

    -   Package Discontinue Date (upon completion of life cycle)

    -   Package Status

-   Device Listing Information

    -   FDA Premarket Submission Number

    -   FDA Device Listing Number

    -   FDA Product Code

    -   Global Medical Device Nomenclature (GMDN) – International device
         type code. See
         [<u>www.gmdnagency.com</u>](http://www.gmdnagency.com) for
         additional information.

-   Other Product Specific Information

    -   Information Listed on Label

    -   Information on Rx Only or OTC

    -   Information on Product Sterility
