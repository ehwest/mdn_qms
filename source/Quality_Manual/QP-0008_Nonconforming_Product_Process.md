4.  **Nonconforming Product Procedure**

 Nonconforming products are documented on nonconformance reports
 (NCR’s). Nonconforming products are generally identified as the
 results of formal verification, inspection, or test activities;
 however, may be identified at any point. The following procedures are
 utilized to ensure the appropriate handling of nonconforming product.
 Nonconforming product trending and analysis is accomplished through
 Management Review and Data Analysis Process (QP-0013).

4.1  **Control of Nonconforming Product**

 Nonconforming product should be appropriately identified and
 quarantined to prevent the inadvertent use or distribution of the
 product. The specific method of identification is dependent on the
 product and may consist of appropriately labeled bins, tags, sticker,
 etc. All nonconforming product shall be segregated from product
 acceptable for distribution.

4.2  **Product Review and Disposition**

 Nonconforming product shall be reviewed and dispositioned
 appropriately by the Material Review Board (MRB). The MRB shall
 consist of functional expertise from each department impacted by the
 nonconformance. The Quality Department is responsible for ensuring the
 necessary parties are represented. Team members typically include
 Operations, Engineering, Marketing, and Quality. Authority to review
 and disposition nonconforming product may be delegated to an
 individual for previously identified and reviewed failure modes. All
 reasonable efforts shall be made to document and disposition NCR’s in
 a timely manner.

4.2.1 **Review**

 The MRB shall review each nonconforming product and document this
 review on the NCR Form. If the nonconformance is determined to be
 systematic, the MRB may escalate the NCR to a CAPA (QP-0012). The MRB
 shall determine and implement any necessary corrections. Review shall
 include potential impacts to other products and whether notification
 is necessary to any external party responsible for the nonconformity.

4.2.2  **Disposition**

 The disposition of the nonconforming product shall be determined and
 approved through the MRB. The disposition of the product shall be
 documented on the NCR form. The following are examples of acceptable
 dispositions:

-   No impact to product, acceptable for distribution

-   Rework

-   Return to Supplier

-   Scrap

-   Acceptance under Concession

 Any product accepted under concession is required to meet all
 regulatory requirements and the identity of the authorizing person(s)
 shall be documented.

4.3  **Rework of Nonconforming Product**

 Nonconforming product that has been dispositioned for rework shall be
 processed under documented procedures that have undergone the same
 authorization as the original production process procedures. Any
 adverse effect of rework upon the product shall be evaluated and
 documented on the NCR Form.
