The authorization, purchasing, and receiving process for software-defined
products is entirely described in other process documents, specifically

4.  **Purchasing Process**

 The purchasing process is managed by Operations and documented on the
 Purchase Requisition Form and/or Supplier Contracts. Upon receipt of
 an approved Purchase Requisition Form, Purchasing issues a Purchase
 Order (PO) to the associated approved supplier. Purchasing may issue a
 Purchase Order (PO) without a Purchase Requisition Form with a verbal
 approval. Once the order has been completed and the product delivered,
 incoming inspections will be completed and upon acceptance, the PO
 will be closed and the associated documentation filed.

4.1  **Purchasing Information**

 Purchasing information shall describe the product, processes,
 services, or software to be purchased including, where appropriate,
 the requirements for approval of product, certificates of compliance,
 procedures, processes, and equipment. This may be in the form of
 drawings, specification sheets or any other format appropriate to the
 item being purchased. The adequacy of specified purchase requirements
 shall be reviewed prior to their communication to the supplier.

4.2  **Planning of Inventory Items**

 Purchasing agreements are established with key contract manufacturers
 and suppliers. These agreements may result in the submission of
 blanket purchase orders with scheduled releases. It is Purchasing’s
 responsibility to monitor the receipts and inventory levels of these
 items to assure there is adequate inventory at all times.

 Inventory items are either planned or unplanned. Unplanned items are
 those that do not require safety stock levels to be established and
 will be ordered only through the use of a Purchase Order or based upon
 delivery schedules documented in purchasing agreements. Planned Items
 are those that require warehouse safety stock levels and reordering
 based upon vendor economic order quantities (EOQs) and lead time.

4.3  **Purchase Order Processing**

4.3.1  **Purchase Request**

 Any employee can communicate the need for a purchase by submitting a
 purchase requisition to Purchasing. The submission may be submitted
 utilizing the Purchase Requisition Form or by directly communicating
 with the Purchasing department. The requisition should include the
 following:

-   Date of Request

-   Date Needed

-   Type of Purchase or account number to be used

-   Description of goods, including part number, quantity, product
     specification if applicable

    -   Special instructions, where appropriate

4.3.2  **Purchase Approval and Execution Procedure**

 Upon obtaining the required approvals of the PRF, the purchase order
 (PO) may be processed. If the purchase is for inventory items or if
 the item will be sold to a customer, the supplier must be on the
 Approved Supplier’s List (ASL). POs are sent to the supplier via
 agreed upon method (see ASL). In the case of credit card purchases, a
 PO will be completed for record. The PO shall contain applicable data
 to ensure that the correct product or service is supplied, including:

-   A line item for each item ordered, including revision, where
     applicable.

    -   For company designed parts, a copy of any drawings or other
         specification data shall be communicated.

    -   For routine components (parts made to manufacturer’s
         specifications) the catalog number will be stated.

-   The requirements for acceptance of the product, procedures,
     processes, equipment, qualifications of personnel or quality
     management systems, that may be appropriate

-   The requirement that no changes to product, processes or services
     may be made without the prior written agreement of the buyer.

 A copy of each PO is maintained by Purchasing.

5.  **Incoming Receipt Procedure**

 All products that impact quality shall undergo acceptance activities
 prior to being moved into inventory. The required acceptance
 activities are specific to the product being received and are defined
 within the associated product/material specification. Inspection
 criteria are developed upon creation of the product/part specification
 and utilize a C=0 sampling plan (see Appendix A) based upon the
 associated risk of the product.

 Acceptance activities are completed and documented by designated
 individuals. All rejections shall be submitted to the Material Review
 Board (MRB) and a Supplier Corrective Action Request (SCAR) is issued
 as necessary. Upon acceptance of product, Purchasing is notified and
 the associated Purchase Order is closed and filed appropriately.

 When the company becomes aware of a change to the purchased product,
 an impact assessment shall be completed and documented to determine
 whether the changes affect the product realization process or the
 medical device.
