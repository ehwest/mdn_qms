### Design Planning:

* Once Executive Management determines that the opportunity is worthy of resources, a Project Team Leader is selected to lead the project and personnel resources from QA/RA, Engineering, Operations, Sales & Marketing and Finance as needed are assigned to form the core project team.  

* The Project Team Leader shall chair individual project team meetings, assigning action items, with completion dates, to the appropriate team members with detailed planning and tracking of tasks. 

* As a guidance and tracking tool, the Project teams will utilize the Design Review Phase Checklist to navigate correctly through the phase gated design and development process.

* A NPD Project Plan/Schedule shall be developed by the Project Manager and shall include all key project tasks, individual assignments, major milestones such as Phase completion, overall timeline/product launch estimated target, and expected resources.  The NPD Project Plan/Schedule shall be reviewed and updated as necessary at each stage of the phase gate process.  


###  Design Phase Reveiw Meeting Requirement

* Design Phase Review meetings are formal meetings with designated key knowledgeable representatives from a cross section of all disciplines within the company (as applicable to the product), and are intended to update the Leadership Team regarding the project meeting the requirements of the specific phase and gaining approval, or receiving disapproval, to move the project to the next Design Phase.

* The Design Phase Review Checklist is utilized as the agenda for the phase review meetings and the meeting minutes are recorded.

* At each Design Phase Review, each item for the specific phase must be reviewed on the checklist and where possible the link for each document shall be listed on the checklist.  If an item is not required for a specific product, a brief justification should be listed on the checklist.

* The Design Review Phase Checklist and meeting minutes are the official records of Design Phase Reviews and shall become part of the Product Design History File (DHF).
* At any point in this process the design project may be terminated or suspended as authorized by the Design Review Board.  Reason for termination or suspension shall be recorded in the project Design History File (DHF).

### Phase 1 - Feasibility & Concept

In Phase 1 the project team’s efforts are focused on ensuring that the opportunity makes good business sense by conducting due diligence and completing the following documents to make this determination:

* Initial Traceability Matrix:  Initial drafts of spreadsheet developed by the Project Manager or Engineering linking the required documents throughout the project to the appropriate pre-requisite documents.   At this stage, the spreadsheet should clearly illustrate which design outputs will satisfy specific design inputs.

### Phase 3 - Validation & Verification

In Phase 3 the project team plans and executes verification and validation activities to prepare for design transfer to manufacturing in Phase 4.  The team verifies that the design outputs meet the design input requirements and validates the final design meets the user needs and intended use of the device.  Devices that are intended to be used with other medical devices shall be verified while connected or interfaced.  Design verification and validation shall be conducted on representative product including initial production units, batches, or their equivalents with documented rationale for the selection.

* Design and Usability Risk Assessments:  Team effort led by the Project Leader assessing and documenting the design and usability risks and associated mitigation actions.  These activities are documents in FMEA’s

* Sterilization and Shelf-Life Testing:  Engineering documentation of the verification of the product sterilization and shelf-life requirements.  Sterilization is applicable only if the product is intended to be distributed sterile or able to be sterilized.  

* Biocompatibility Testing: Engineering documentation of the verification of the product biocompatibility requirements.  Standards such as ISO 10993 provide industry accepted testing methodology.  

* Software Validation:  Engineering documentation of the verification of the software design and the validation methods utilized to validate that the software conforms to user needs and intended use.  Applicable only if design incorporates software to achieve functional requirements.  Standards such as IEC 62304 provide methodology.
