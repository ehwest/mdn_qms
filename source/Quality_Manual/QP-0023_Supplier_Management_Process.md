4.  **Supplier Management Procedure**

 The company utilizes a tiered system for managing suppliers. The
 supplier level is dependent upon risk associated with the product or
 service provided and the potential for impacting the quality of the
 products and services provided to our customers. The supplier level is
 determined by the Quality Department and documented on QF-0023-1,
 Supplier Approval Form. Level 1 Suppliers are considered critical
 suppliers. The list below provides examples of suppliers for each
 category:

-   **Level 1 Suppliers** – Suppliers of finished medical devices

-   **Level 2 Suppliers** – Contract manufacturer of components and/or
     supplier of critical services including distribution and
     warehousing. Suppliers of components with a moderate to high
     associated risk.

-   **Level 3 Suppliers** – Component suppliers, Calibration and Test
     Labs, Clinical Sites, Quality Management Services

-   **Level 4 Suppliers** – Non-QMS Suppliers, Distributors and
     Manufacturers of Off-the-Shelf items with an acceptable quality
     history.

-   **Non Production Resource (NPR)** – Business entity, government
     agency, or utility provider that provides a service or product
     that is not used in any products.

4.1.  **Supplier Planning and Selection**

 The need for a new supplier is generally identified through activities
 associated with Design and Development, Engineering Change Orders,
 and/or CAPA’s. The selection of a supplier to be approved is
 determined with input from Engineering, and Operations. Preference
 shall be given to expanding the qualification of an existing supplier
 with acceptable performance over approving a new supplier, where
 practical. When possible, multiple quotes shall be obtained for the
 desired product or service prior to selecting a supplier for
 evaluation. The table below identifies the minimum requirements for
 supplier selection based on the supplier level

**Minimum Requirements for Initial Supplier Selection**

Level|Good or Service|FDA Registration|ISO 13485/17025 Cert|ISO 9001 Cert|Approved QMS|Validated Processes
-----|---------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------|-------------|
I|Contract Mfg          |Y|Y| |Y|AR
II|Component Mfg        |N|Y|Y|Y|AR
III|Component & Services|N|Y|Y|Y|AR
IV|Non-QMS              |N| | | | |


4.2  **Supplier Evaluation and Approval**

 Suppliers shall be evaluated to ensure the entity is capable of
 supplying products and/or services in accordance with company
 requirements and evidence of the evaluation shall be maintained within
 the supplier file.

 If the supplier will perform processes that are required to be
 validated to ensure quality requirements of the final product have
 been met, the associated validation documents shall be obtained and
 reviewed for acceptability before the supplier will be approved.

 Suppliers are evaluated to ensure the entity is capable of supplying
 products and/or services in accordance with company requirements and
 evidence of the evaluation is maintained within the supplier file.
 These records contain at minimum one of the following items
 demonstrating supplier evaluation where applicable. Additional
 Evaluation information may be included as desired.

 Final supplier approval is documented on QF-0023-1, Supplier Approval
 Form

 Evaluation Criteria may include the following criteria or other
 criteria as seen as sufficient to ensure final product quality
 requirements are met:

-   Completed Supplier Survey (QF-0023-2), Supplier Audit Report
     (QP-0015) and/or QMS Certification

-   Resumes, Curriculum Vitae, Licenses, or Certificates

-   Contract Agreements

-   Evidence of Supplier Controls

-   Evidence of compliance to 21 CFR 820 quality system requirements for
     functions outsourced to the supplier

-   Completed 1<supst</sup> Article Inspections (QF-0023-4)

 Level 1 Suppliers of medical devices shall have a valid ISO 13485
 certificate issued by a notified body with a scope of registration
 appropriate to the product being manufactured.

 Level 1 Suppliers require an onsite audit to ensure compliance with
 applicable FDA regulations and Quality Management System requirements
 for the activities outsourced to the supplier.

 Level 1 Suppliers shall be re-evaluated and/or audited every three (3)
 years to ensure continued compliance and performance. Tracking of
 these activities is maintained on the Supplier Audit Schedule.

4.3.  **Supplier Controls**

 Supplier Controls to be considered are listed below. Where sufficient
 objective evidence of supplier controls to ISO 13485, 21 CFR 820 or
 other Quality System Requirements cannot be verified, a supplier audit
 shall be conducted in accordance with QP-0015 – Quality Audits.

-   **Process Input Controls** - raw material, machine
     programs/settings, revision control of process documentation, and
     (if applicable) temperature settings/speeds/feeds/etc.

-   **Process Maintenance** - calibration of machines/process
     indicators, and maintenance of machine tools and periodic toll
     verification cycles

-   **Traceability of Records** - raw material, finished lot, and
     inspection/acceptance data

-   **Verification and Acceptance**:

    -   Incoming, In-Process, and Final Inspection and Testing

    -   Risk Assessment and Control Plan

    -   100% inspection for final acceptance or a sampling plan. If a
         sampling plan, is there rationale for the plan and was the
         plan approved?

    -   Product yield information trending

-   **Validation** - For any critical dimension that is not verified
     each time, what validation has been completed to support no
     verification of the specification? Validations are reviewed and
     approved for adequacy to ensure product quality requirements are
     met.

 First Article Inspections (FAI’s) are utilized to verify the effective
 communication and implementation of product specifications and
 supplier controls. First article inspections are documented on
 QF-0023-4 and verify critical specifications of the product.

4.4.  **Supplier Measurement and Monitoring**

 Suppliers are monitored and measured to ensure acceptable performance
 and identify areas in need of improvement. Data is obtained from
 multiple sources including, but not limited to:

-   NCR/SCAR’s

-   On Time Delivery

-   Customer Complaints

-   Audit Reports

 An evaluation of the supplier data is completed annually as part of
 the Management review process. Continual poor performance may initiate
 a supplier audit, SCAR’s, or debarment from the ASL.

4.5.  **Feedback and Communication**

 Performance feedback is provided to suppliers via corrective action
 requests, supplier audit reports, and general business correspondence.
 In the event that material is received out of specification, the
 supplier will be issued a Supplier Corrective Action Request (SCAR)
 (QF-0023-3).

-   Containment Actions – Actions taken to quarantine and prevent the
     distribution of other impacted products.

-   Root Cause Determination – An investigation to identify the root
     cause of the issue including potential impacts to other product
     and historical review.

-   Corrective and Preventive Actions – The actions taken to correct the
     issues and prevent the issue from re-occurring.

-   Effectiveness Check – Verification activities to ensure the
     corrective and preventive action were effective.

 The supplier must make all reasonable efforts to complete corrective
 and preventive actions and provide documented evidence of completion.
 Root cause and corrective action shall be identified within 30 days
 and implemented within 90 days unless otherwise agreed to by Quality
 Assurance. Failure to supply products and/or services that meet
 company specifications or failure to respond to or complete SCAR’s
 will result in Debarred status on the ASL.

4.6  **Approved Supplier List**

 Upon evaluation and acceptance, a supplier is added to the Approved
 Supplier List (ASL). The Approved Supplier List is approved by
 Quality.

4.6.1  **Required Information**

 The following information is recorded for all suppliers listed on the
 ASL:

+ Supplier Name
+ Supplier Level
+ Supplier Status
+ Approved Location
+ Part Number (if applicable)
+ Supplier Part Number

4.6.2.  **Supplier Status**

 Each supplier on the ASL is assigned a status. This status can change
 as the results of Supplier Measurement and Monitoring, SCAR’s, and/or
 management review of ASL. Inactive suppliers shall be re-assessed
 against the supplier qualification requirements and assessment
 documented prior to being upgraded to an Approved status.

-   **Approved** – a supplier that has met all requirements for approval
     and maintained an acceptable level of quality.

-   **Debarred** – a supplier that is no longer usable or has failed to
     successfully establish and maintain an acceptable level of
     quality.

-   **Inactive** – an approved supplier that has had a lapse in activity
     (receipt of product, or PO issuance) greater than 2-years.

-   **Conditional** – a supplier that meets some, but not all the
     requirements for approval.
