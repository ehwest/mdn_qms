# Business Associate Agreement


Hello Medical Data Networks Team!

As you are likely aware, Medical Data Networks has established a Quality Management System (QMS) that includes processes, procedures and documentation that conform with U.S. and international regulatory requirements.

One of the requirements is that the organization receives communication regarding our QMS, including information about the importance of meeting customer and applicable regulatory requirements. This email does just that and will be sent annually.

If you have not done so already, please read these documents, available in Medical Data Networks Quality Management System:
Medical Data Networks Quality Objectives, available in DOC-0003 Medical Data Networks Quality Manual
TRN-0002 Employee Security Practices
DOC-0001 Medical Data Networks Design and Development Process

If you understand the above documents, then please reply to support@t1pal.com and say "I have reviewed and understand Medical Data Network's Quality Management System. I understand the importance of meeting customer as well as applicable regulatory requirements."

If you do not understand anything about our QMS, please send email to support@t1pal.com with your question(s). Also feel free to escalate issues to Medical Data Networks Board of Directors or with the appropriate regulatory authority.

Thank you for your commitment to Medical Data Networks quality objectives and to fulfilling Medical Data Networks mission! And for being an awesome person.


Ben West
CEO, Medical Data Networks LLC
