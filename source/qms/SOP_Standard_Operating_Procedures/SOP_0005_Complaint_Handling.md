# Complaint Handling

This procedure outlines how Medical Data Networks LLC (MDN) receives, reviews, and evaluates complaints associated with T1Pal operations. 
It is intended to be compliant with [FDA Title 21 Part 820 Section 820.198 Complaint files.](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=820.198)

This procedure is used by Customer Operations personnel, who have the necessary education, background, training and experience to receive and document complaints for all of MDN’s products.

## Definitions

### "Complaint" 
Any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of an MDN product or service after it is released for commercial distribution.

### "Inquiry"
A user question regarding the use of a MDN product that does not meet the definition of a complaint (e.g., a question about how a feature works, or how to update apps). 

If repeated inquiries are received from different users regarding the same topic, corrective action may be needed because repeated inquiries of the same nature may indicate a user/use problem.

### "Malfunction"

A Malfunction is the failure of a device to meet any of its performance specifications or otherwise to perform __as intended__. 

Performance specifications include all claims made __in the labeling for the device__. The intended performance of a device refers to the objective __intent of the person legally responsible for the labeling__ of the device. 

#### "Serious Injury Definition"

An injury that:

   * Is life threatening, 
  
   * Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to body structure, or 
  
   * Necessitates medical or surgical intervention by a healthcare professional to:
  
     * preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to body structure or 
    
     * relieve unanticipated temporary impairment of a body function or unanticipated temporary damage to body structure. 
     
Temporary impairment of a body function or temporary damage to body structure is unanticipated if reference to such impairment or damage is not made in the labeling for the device or, if such reference is made in the labeling for the device, the manufacturer or importer of the device determines that such impairment or damage has occurred or is occurring more frequently or with greater severity than is stated in the labeling for the device or, if there is not any pertinent statement in the labeling, than is usual for the device.

Properly labelled, a product/service offering a secondary display which further, excludes use cases covering the calculation or delivery of therapies, would be unexpected to fail in such a way to create a reportable event.

## User Communication 

Any contact (phone, email, support ticket, website inquiry, in person) from a user regarding an MDC product or service.

## Complaint Handling Policy

MDN may receive Complaints through any form of User Communication.   However, all Complaints will be submitted to, or forwarded to MDN's Support team within 1 business day.  This is accomplished when a support ticket is created on the technical support [web page](https://t1pal.HELPY.io).

In addition, this particular ticketing
system facilitates the collection of additional detail by linked email exchanges as needed to fully explain the complaint and/or any conditions surrounding the complaint.  Therefore, complaints may also be received when an email is sent to support@t1pal.com and/or support@t1pa.helpy.com.

All Complaints will be evaluated by an MDC Vice President or higher rank employee. 

Complaints that meet the definition of a Reportable Event will be clearly tagged within the ticketing system and added to (or used to update) a Reportable Event Spreadsheet maintained by MDN Quality VP.

All Reportable Events will be promptly investigated by a MDN quality VP. 
Risk analysis, mitigation and control will be performed per chapter 4 "Risk and Hazard Management".

Complaints that are not deemed to be Reportable Events will be evaluated regularly as part of a routine review.

Reportable Events that result in Serious Injury will be reported to the appropriate regulatory authority.


## Requirements for Maintaining Complaint Files.

1. MDN shall maintain complaint files. Each manufacturer shall establish and maintain procedures for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating complaints by a formally designated unit. Such procedures shall ensure that:

    * All complaints are processed in a uniform and timely manner;

    * Oral complaints are documented upon receipt; and

   * Complaints are evaluated to determine whether the complaint represents an event which is required to be reported to FDA under part 803 of this chapter, Medical Device Reporting.

2. Each manufacturer shall review and evaluate all complaints to determine whether an investigation is necessary. When no investigation is made, the manufacturer shall maintain a record that includes the reason no investigation was made and the name of the individual responsible for the decision not to investigate.

3. Any complaint involving the possible failure of a device, labeling, or packaging to meet any of its specifications shall be reviewed, evaluated, and investigated, unless such investigation has already been performed for a similar complaint and another investigation is not necessary.

4. Any complaint that represents an event which must be reported to FDA under part 803 of this chapter shall be promptly reviewed, evaluated, and investigated by a designated individual(s) and shall be maintained in a separate portion of the complaint files or otherwise clearly identified. In addition to the information required by §820.198(e), records of investigation under this paragraph shall include a determination of:

   * Whether the device failed to meet specifications;

   * Whether the device was being used for treatment or diagnosis; and

   * The relationship, if any, of the device to the reported incident or adverse event.

5. When an investigation is made under this section, a record of the investigation shall be maintained by the formally designated unit identified in paragraph (a) of this section. The record of investigation shall include:

    * The name of the device;

    * The date the complaint was received;

    * Any unique device identifier (UDI) or universal product code (UPC), and any other device identification(s) and control number(s) used;

    * The name, address, and phone number of the complainant;

    * The nature and details of the complaint;

    * The dates and results of the investigation;

    * Any corrective action taken; and

    * Any reply to the complainant.

6.  When the manufacturer's formally designated complaint unit is located at a site separate from the manufacturing establishment, the investigated complaint(s) and the record(s) of investigation shall be reasonably accessible to the manufacturing establishment.

7.  If a manufacturer's formally designated complaint unit is located outside of the United States, records required by this section shall be reasonably accessible in the United States at either:

    * A location in the United States where the manufacturer's records are regularly kept; or

    * The location of the initial distributor.
