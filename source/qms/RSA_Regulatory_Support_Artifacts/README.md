# Regulatory Support Artifacts

## Purpose

This document sets forth the specific means for following the FDA de novo regulatory pathway for the T1Pal product.

In a [meeting with FDA on 1/27/2015, -- Q141084/S002 ](https://github.com/ehwest/mdn_qms/blob/master/RSA_Regulatory_Support_Artifacts/minutes-pdfjam.pdf) the FDA set forth the de novo regulatory pathway for Nightscout to accomplish the following.

- [ ]  Register with the FDA
- [ ]  Meet "Special Controls"
- [ ]  Meet "Appropriate Validations"
- [ ]  Document "Quality Controls"

In the same meeting the FDA outlined the definition of **"Special Controls"** as follows:

- [ ]  Devices must protect against unauthorized access to and modification of data.

- [ ]  Device labeling must display the following warning: 

  **Dosing decisions should not be made based on this device.**
  
  **The user should follow instructions on the continuous glucose monitoring system.**
  
- [ ]  Device labeling must include the following limitation:  

  **This device is not intended to replace self-monitoring practices advised by a physician.**

## Registering with the FDA

**Note:  This section will be updated once Medical Data Networks LLC raises the cash to pay FDA Registration Fees**

Medical Data Networks LLC the organization providing the T1Pal.com "device." intends to Register with the FDA as soon as possible.
As of this release of the Quality Management System, the high fees (for the size of company) represents a very real barrier 
to compliance.  The fees for establishing identity are currently approximately 10 times the sum of the current annual expenses of the T1Pal service provider, and more than 3 times the sum of expected annual revenues.   Until monthly revenues approach the [2020 Establishment Identity fee of $5286](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-your-device/device-registration-and-listing), this is not possible and itself jeopardizes subscriber access to T1Pal.com

## Meeting Special Controls

The "special controls" outlined above may all be directly linked to T1Pal.com product requirements that are also the target of verification by Medical Data Networks LLC Quality Management system.


* Protect against unauthorized access to and modification of data.

* Warning Labels: dosing warning, follow instructions, not intended to replace self-monitoring

Inaddition, not specifically mentioned is an obvious requirement to provide labelling for intended use:

* A definitive statement of the [T1Pal Intended Use]( https://github.com/ehwest/mdn_qms/blob/master/PD_Product_Definition/PD_0002_Intended_Use.md)  is provided within this Quality Managemnet System.

## Meeting Appropriate Validations

A spreadsheet that is part of this Quality Management System is provided and links product requirements and validations.

## Document Quality Controls

This Quality Management System provides an enumeration of all of the Document Quality Controls applicable to the T1Pal.com product.
