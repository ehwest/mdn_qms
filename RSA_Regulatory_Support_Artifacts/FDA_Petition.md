__Class II 510(k) exemption petition__

This letter is our petition for an exemption for a 
new "software as a Medical Device (SaMD)", a web site,
branded __"T1Pal.com"__) 
that we assert aligns with FDA classification of a Class II device requiring no PMN.

As provided by FDAMA, FDA exempted through a FEDERAL REGISTER (FR) notice, 62 class II 
device types from premarket notification (section 510(k)) requirements on January 21, 1998 (63 FR 3142). 

Within the document for "Procedures for Class II Device Exemption from
Premarket Notification, Guidance for Industry and CDRH staff", the
FDA, upon its own initiative or upon a petition of an interested person, 
may exempt a class II device from premarket notification requirements under section510(m)(2).
