## Purpose

[FDA rules](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/classify-your-medical-device/class-i-ii-exemptions) have evolved to exempt certain Class I and Class II devices
from premarket notifications (via 510(k) documentation.  
This applies specifically to T1Pal operating software as a device, and
published in the FDA's Product Classification database.

However, T1Pal must also comply with "regulatory controls" promogulated by the FDA.
These regulatory controls include the following:

## Registering the T1Pal establishment and device with the FDA

Medical Data Networks, LLC has for FY 2021 registered the establishment responsible for
assembly and operations of the T1Pal service (as a device), and further registered
T1Pal itself as a registered device.   As part of the registration, it was
determined that the T1Pal device is Substantitiavely Equivalent (SE) to
devices consistent with both "PJT"  and "PKU" FDA product codes.

FDA rules say that a device is substantially equivalent if, in comparison to a predicate it:

* has the same intended use as the predicate; and
* has the same technological characteristics as the predicate;
or
* has the same intended use as the predicate; and
* has different technological characteristics and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness; and
* the information submitted to FDA demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as the legally marketed device.
