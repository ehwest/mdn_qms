# Corrective and Preventive Action

This section  establishes a standard operating procedures for corrective and preventive action.

For corrective actions, this procedure sets forth the process for determining the cause of nonconformities, initiating corrective action(s) and performing follow-up to ensure that the corrective action(s) have been effective in eliminating the cause of the nonconformity to prevent recurrence.

For preventive actions, this procedure will describe the process of identifying nonconformities and determine actions to prevent their occurrence.

This applies to all medical and research software devices designed and developed by Medical Data Networks LLC (MDN).

## Sources of Nonconformities and Opportunities for Improvement

MDN may receive reports of quality issues, complaints and nonconformities, or opportunities for improvement through email, phone calls, social media, or verbal conversations. 

Nonconformances may also be identified through other means such as external or internal audits, and automated monitoring tools. 

Possible mechanisms for handling issues include (but are not limited to):

 * The employee may generate a new Github.com repository issue or comment on an existing Github.com repository issue indicating a Bug, Feature Request, Suggestion. New Github.com repository issues may include risk analysis per QMS SOP Risk Managmeent Procedures.
 
 * The employee may respond to the report over email, phone, or using our customer support tracking system.
 
 * Statistical methods will be applied when necessary and as appropriate at the discretion of management. For example, emails to [support@t1pal.com](mailto:support@t1pal.com) may be analyzed for patterns of recurring customer complaints. When performed, such analysis will be documented and stored in Google Drive.
 
 * Based upon the analysis of these issues, it is determined whether a corrective action or preventive action is required.

At the discretion of MDN management or employees, non-conformities that involve severe operational issues, security issues or invalid data may also be detailed in a root cause analysis document.

## Verification of Effectiveness

 * MDN verifies that the corrective or preventive action does not adversely affect the ability to meet applicable regulatory requirements or the safety and performance of the medical device.
 
 * MDN establishes a date to determine the effectiveness of the corrective or preventive action. Effectiveness verification shall include objective evidence to demonstrate that the corrective or preventive action is effective.

## Dissemination of Information

 * All information will be disseminated to appropriate MDN employees using email, and/or a Github repository owned by MDN.
 
 * Management will review all relevant information. Decisions about corrective and preventive action to be taken in current or future activities will be documented as Github.com repository issues. This information is also presented at Management Operations Review meetings.

## Documentation

All documentation regarding quality issues and corrective and preventive action are permanently store in the QMS "Post Mortem" document store folder.
